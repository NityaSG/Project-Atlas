"Caffeine is a natural compound found in plant seeds that after consumption by humans effects the central nervous system as well as the cardiovascular system. In general, the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver are involved in the biodegradation of caffeine, which gives paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline products. There has been debate for many years why multiple products are obtained and how their distributions are determined. To this end we performed a high-level computational study using a combination of molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical approaches. A series of quantum chemical cluster models on the mechanism of caffeine activation by P450 model complexes give hydrogen atom abstraction barriers that predicts the correct ordering and statistical distribution of products. Our studies highlight that second-coordination sphere effects and thermochemical properties of the substrate determine the product distributions.",0
"This study aims to introduce compound glycyrrhizin injection for the treatment of rosacea by mesoderm therapy, and further analyze the therapeutic and aesthetic effects of this treatment method and its impact on the dermatological quality of life index, which provides new ideas and methods for cosmetic dermatology treatment of rosacea.",1
"Oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense is an economically important aquaculture species in China, Japan, and Vietnam. In commercial prawn farming, feed cost constitutes about 50 to 65% of the actual variable cost. Improving feed conversion efficiency in prawn culture will not only increase economic benefit, but also save food and protect the environment. The common indicators used for feed conversion efficiency include feed conversion ratio (FCR), feed efficiency ratio (FER), and residual feed intake (RFI). Among these, RFI is much more suitable than FCR and FER during the genetic improvement of feed conversion efficiency for aquaculture species.",0
"The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) including dialysis is growing. Several studies have shown favorable results of DOAC compared with warfarin regarding bleeding risk but no difference in stroke protection. However, these studies had poor time in therapeutic range (TTR), in the warfarin comparison group.",1
"In this work, the Br functional group on the ligand UiO-66-Br was modified with a Bi-O bond through the secondary solvothermal method, and the synthesis method of visible light catalyst UB (UiO-66-BiOBr) with high electron mobility was explored. The findings indicate that the effective charge transfer of the functional group-modified material UB is 2.98 times and 1.22 times that of BiOBr and traditional UiO-66/BiOBr heterojunctions, respectively. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, the removal rate of tetracycline can reach 88.71%, and the photocatalytic performance is 22.73 times higher than that of UiO-66-Br. Moreover, it maintains good adsorption and photocatalytic performance under different laboratory and actual engineering water environment conditions. In the complex water environment of municipal wastewater, the degradation effect reaches more than 80%. Finally, the decomposition pathways of TC and ecotoxicities of the intermediates were analyzed via combining theoretical calculation, LC-MS/MS, and T.E.S.T.",0
"In more than 50 to 90% of type 2 diabetic patients, under the influence of various factors, the production of islet amyloid polypeptide or amylin in pancreatic beta cells increases. Spontaneous accumulation of amylin peptide in the form of insoluble amyloid fibrils and soluble oligomers is one of the main causes of beta cell death in diabetic patients. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of pyrogallol, as a phenolic compound, on inhibiting the formation of amylin protein amyloid fibrils. In this study, different techniques such as the thioflavin T (ThT) and 1-Anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) fluorescence intensity and the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum, will be used to investigate the effects of this compound on inhibiting the formation of amyloid fibrils. To investigate the interaction sites of pyrogallol with amylin, docking studies were performed. Our results that pyrogallol in a dose-dependent manner (0.5:1, 1:1, and 5:1, Pyr to Amylin) inhibits the amylin amyloid fibrils formation. Docking analysis revealed that pyrogallol forms hydrogen bonds with valine 17 and asparagine 21. In addition, this compound forms 2 more hydrogen bonds with asparagine 22. This compound also forms hydrophobic bonds with histidine 18. Considering this data and the direct relationship between oxidative stress and the formation of amylin amyloid accumulations in diabetes, the use of compounds with both antioxidant and anti-amyloid properties can be considered an important therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes.",0
"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a main cause of death all around the world. There is a close relationship between myocardial infarction (MI) and depression. MI patients with untreated depression had higher mortality than those without depression. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effect of escitalopram in treating a model under MI and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS).",1
"There is a debate over the use of aspirin after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of aspirin after TKA, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared aspirin with low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH).",1
"Oils derived from non-traditional seeds, such as safflower, milk thistle, and black cumin seeds, have recently grown in popularity. Seed oil is in high demand due to consumer interest in illness prevention and health promotion through healthier diets that include a high concentration of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidant phenolic components. This study assessed the quality characteristics of cold-pressed seed oil at three unique storage times: at the beginning of the trial (i.e., before storage), after 2 months, and after 4 months. The results of the performed analyses indicate that the acidity of extracted black cumin, safflower, and milk thistle seed oil fluctuates considerably over time. The highest acidity level change was detected for black cumin seed oil, from 10.26% after the extraction to 16.96% after 4 months of storage at 4 °C. Consequently, changes between pre- and post-storage peroxide concentrations were discernible after four months. Peroxide value in milk thistle and safflower seed oils increased by 0.92 meq/kg and 2.00 meq/kg, respectively, during the assessed storage time, while that of black cumin was very high and fluctuated. The storage period substantially affects oxidative changes and the oxidation stability of the oil. Major changes were observed in the polyunsaturated fatty acids in seed oil during storage. The essential changes were detected in the black cumin seed oil odor profile after 4 storage months. Their quality and stability, as well as the nature of the changes that occur during the storage of oil, require extensive investigation.",0
"Chinese chestnut shell is a by-product of chestnut food processing and is rich in polyphenols. This study sought to investigate the effect of chestnut shell polyphenol extract (CSP) on weight loss and lipid reduction in a 12-week high-fat diet (HFD)-induced murine obesity model. CSP (300 mg per kg body weight) was administered intragastrically daily. AG490, a JAK2 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was also intraperitoneally injected. The results showed that an HFD induced leptin resistance (LR). Compared to corresponding values in the HFD group, CSP treatment improved blood lipid levels, weight, and leptin levels in obese mice (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Additionally, CSP treatment enhanced enzyme activity by improving total antioxidant capacity, attenuating oxidative stress, and reducing fat droplet accumulation and inflammation in the liver, epididymal, and retroperitoneal adipose tissue. CSP also activated the LEPR-JAK2/STAT3-PTP1B-SOCS-3 signal transduction pathway in hypothalamus tissue and improved LR while regulating the expression of proteins related to lipid metabolism (PPARγ, FAS, and LPL) in white adipose tissue in the retroperitoneal cavity. However, the amelioration of lipid metabolism by CSP was dependent on JAK2. Molecular docking simulation further demonstrated the strong binding affinity of procyanidin C1 (-10.3983297 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) and procyanidin B1 (-9.12686729 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) to the crystal structure of JAK2. These results suggest that CSP may be used to reduce HFD-induced obesity with potential application as a functional food additive.",0
"Pharmaceuticals, which have been praised for protecting countless lives, have become a new category of environmental pollutants in recent decades as most of these pharmaceutical compounds are discovered in water bodies in concentrations ranging from ng/L to mg/L. Recently, metal-free g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (GCN)-based composites have received considerable attention for the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds. In this study, GCN/BiOCl composite was prepared using a simple ultrasonication-assisted stirring method and characterized using various analytical and spectroscopic techniques including XRD, FTIR, PL, Elemental mapping, UV-DRS, FESEM, HRTEM, and TGA. The as-prepared composite was utilized to degrade levofloxacin (LVX) under solar light irradiation and showed excellent stability for the degradation of LVX. Furthermore, the universality of the GCN/BiOCl composite was investigated by degrading diverse pharmaceuticals such as ofloxacin (OFX), norfloxacin (NOX), ciprofloxacin (COX), and ketorolac tromethamine (KTC) in an aqueous phase. Therefore, this work provides an effective method to degrade pharmaceutical contaminants simultaneously in water using GCN/BiOCl composite.",0
"In the U.S., intentional self-poisonings with analgesics that are available without a prescription increased from 2000 to 2018. Given concerns regarding mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examined and compared trends in pediatric and adult intentional self-poisoning with acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen from 2016 to 2021 using the National Poison Data System (NPDS) to see if these trends have continued. We extracted annual case counts of all suspected suicide attempts from intentional poisoning, and of suspected suicide attempts resulting in major effects or death, from the NPDS for non-prescription single ingredient adult formulation acetaminophen, non-prescription single ingredient adult formulation aspirin, single ingredient formulation ibuprofen, and single ingredient formulation naproxen. We enumerated the cases by year, age, and gender. Most cases of intentional self-poisoning within the review period involved acetaminophen and ibuprofen and the 13-19-year-olds constituted the highest proportion of intentional self-poisoning cases across age groups for all four analgesics. Cases involving females predominated cases involving males by 3:1 or greater. The 13-19-year-old age group also represented the largest proportion of cases that resulted in major clinical effects or deaths. An increasing trend in suicide poisoning cases with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was observed in the 6-19-years age group and this trend appeared to exacerbate from 2020 to 2021 corresponding with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic period.",1
"The iron reduction coupled with ammonia oxidation process (Feammox) is a biological reaction process associated with the nitrogen cycle that has been discovered in recent years. In this study, the iron-reducing bacterium Klebsiella sp. FC61 was attached by synthesizing nano-loadings of iron tetroxide (nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) onto rice husk biochar (RBC), and the RBC-nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was used as an electron shuttle to participate in the biological iron reduction process of soluble and insoluble Fe<sup>3+</sup> to improve the ammonia oxidation efficiency to 81.82%. This acceleration of electron transfer increased the carbon consumption rate and further tuned up the COD removal efficiency to 98.00%. The Feammox could be coupled with iron denitrification for internal nitrogen/iron cycling to reduce the accumulation of nitrate by-products and achieve the recycling of iron. In addition, pollutants such as Ni<sup>2+</sup>, ciprofloxacin, and formed chelates could be removed by pore adsorption and π-π interactions using bio-iron precipitates produced by iron-reducing bacteria.",0
"Increasing antimicrobial resistance in urinary tract infection is a major healthcare concern. In this study, we evaluate the patterns of resistance exhibited by the most implicated microorganisms in urine infections. This approach is a prerequisite for an appropriate and successful empiric therapy in ambulatory patients.",0
"Coverage of antenatal iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation and malaria chemoprophylaxis remains low in many low-income and middle-income settings. We assessed the effectiveness of personal information (INFO) sessions and personal information session plus home deliveries (INFO+DELIV) to increase coverage of IFA supplementation and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), and their effectiveness on postpartum anaemia and malaria infection.",1
"The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines have been approved for children and adolescents for protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This longitudinal study aimed to compare adverse outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (ND) (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD], communication disorders, intellectual disability, and tic disorders) and healthy control children.",1
"The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in preventing thromboembolic events in patients with fractures. The present meta-analysis was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched EMBASE, PubMed, and EBSCO to find articles comparing aspirin and LMWH in patients with orthopedic trauma from inception to April 15, 2023. Limits were set to studies published in the English language only. Outcomes assessed in this meta-analysis included VTE and all-cause mortality. VTE can manifest as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. For safety analysis, rates of wound complication, infection, and bleeding complications were compared between the two study groups. A total of three studies were included in this meta-analysis enrolling 12884 patients. The study found no significant difference between the two groups in the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism, and aspirin was non-inferior to LMWH for the prevention of all-cause mortality in patients. Additionally, no significant safety risk was associated with aspirin thromboprophylaxis. These findings suggest that inexpensive over-the-counter aspirin is as effective as LMWH in terms of safety and efficacy profile, making it a feasible option to consider in clinical practice.",1
"The delivery and accumulation of therapeutic drugs into cancer cells without affecting healthy cells are a major challenge for antitumor therapy. Here, we report the synthesis of a liposomal hybrid gold nano-assembly with enhanced photothermal activity for lung cancer treatment. The core components of the nano-assembly include gold nanorods coated with a mesoporous silica shell that offers an excellent drug-loading surface for encapsulation of doxorubicin. To enhance the photothermal capacity of nano-assembly, IR 780 dye was loaded inside a thermo-sensitive liposome, and then, the core nano-assembly was wrapped within the liposome, and GE-11 peptide and folic acid were conjugated onto the surface of the liposome to give the final nano-assembly [(GM@Dox) LI]-PF. The dual targeting approach of [(GM@Dox) LI]-PF leads to enhanced cellular uptake and improves the accumulation of nano-assemblies in cancer cells that overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor and folate. The exposure of near-infrared laser irradiation can trigger photothermal-induced structural disruption of the nano-assembly, which allows for the precise and controllable release of Dox at targeted sites. Additionally, chemo-photothermal therapy was shown to be 11 times more effective in cancer cell treatment when compared to Dox alone. Our systematic study suggests that the nano-assemblies facilitate the cancer cells undergoing apoptosis via an intrinsic mitochondrial pathway that can be directly triggered by the chemo-photothermal treatment. This study offers an appealing candidate that holds great promise for synergistic cancer treatment.",0
"Solid-nanopores/nanopipettes have the exquisite ability to reveal the changes in molecular volume due to the advantages of adjustable size, good rigidity and low noise. Herein, a new platform for sensing application was established based on G-quadruplex-hemin DNAzyme (GQH) functionalized gold-coated nanopipettes. In this method, GQH was immobilized on gold-coated nanopipette, which could be used as a catalyst for the reaction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) to promote the conversion of ABTS to ABTS<sup>+</sup> ions inside gold-coated nanopipette, and the change of transmembrane ion current could be monitored in real time. At the optimal conditions, there was a correlation between the ion current and the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in a certain range, which could be used for the hydrogen peroxide sensing. The GQH immobilized nanopipette provides a useful platform to investigate enzymatic catalysis in confined environment, which can be used in electrocatalysis, sensing and fundamental electrochemistry.",0
"In this study, through virtual screening and <i>in vitro</i> bioactivity assays, we discovered that (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), a polyphenol compound extracted from green tea, demonstrated marked anti-Ser/Thr phosphatase (Stp1) activity towards <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 8.35 μM. By targeting <i>S. aureus</i> Stp1, ECG prevented the up-regulation of virulence gene and the formation of antibody membrane and protected the mice from <i>S. aureus</i> infection. Through MD simulation, the allosteric inhibitory mechanism of ECG on Stp1 was determined. The Stp1-ECG complex model underwent a significant change in conformation; its flap subdomain changed from opening to closing, whereas Stp1 activity was lost when bound to ECG. In addition, the MD simulation results of Stp1 and several tea polyphenol compounds showed that gallate groups and fewer adjacent phenolic hydroxyl groups contributed to the binding of Stp1 and inhibitors. As an inhibitor targeting <i>S. aureus</i> Stp1, ECG reduced the pathogenicity of <i>S. aureus</i> without inhibiting <i>S. aureus</i>, which largely reduced the possibility of drug resistance. Our findings demonstrated a novel molecular mechanism of green tea as the usual drink against <i>S. aureus</i> infection and elucidated the future design of allosteric inhibitors targeting Stp1.",0
"There is an increasing interest in the use of automation in plant production settings. Here, we employed a robotic platform to induce controlled mechanical stimuli (CMS) aiming to improve basil quality. Semi-targeted UHPLC-qToF-MS analysis of organic acids, amino acids, phenolic acids, and phenylpropanoids revealed changes in basil secondary metabolism under CMS, which appear to be associated with changes in taste, as revealed by different means of sensory evaluation (overall liking, check-all-that-apply, and just-about-right analysis). Further network analysis combining metabolomics and sensory data revealed novel links between plant metabolism and sensory quality. Amino acids and organic acids including maleic acid were negatively associated with basil quality, while increased levels of secondary metabolites, particularly linalool glucoside, were associated with improved basil taste. In summary, by combining metabolomics and sensory analysis we reveal the potential of automated CMS on crop production, while also providing new associations between plant metabolism and sensory quality.",0
"Citrin deficiency (CD) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by loss-of-function of the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate transporter, CITRIN, which is involved in both the urea cycle and malate-aspartate shuttle. Patients with CD develop hepatosteatosis and hyperammonemia but there is no effective therapy for CD. Currently, there are no animal models that faithfully recapitulate the human CD phenotype. Accordingly, we generated a CITRIN knockout HepG2 cell line using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas 9 genome editing technology to study metabolic and cell signaling defects in CD. CITRIN KO cells showed increased ammonia accumulation, higher cytosolic ratio of reduced versus oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and reduced glycolysis. Surprisingly, these cells showed impaired fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial activity. CITRIN KO cells also displayed increased cholesterol and bile acid metabolism resembling those observed in CD patients. Remarkably, normalizing cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio by nicotinamide riboside increased glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation but had no effect on the hyperammonemia suggesting the urea cycle defect was independent of the aspartate/malate shuttle defect of CD. The correction of glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism defects in CITRIN KO cells by reducing cytoplasmic NADH:NAD+ levels suggests this may be a novel strategy to treat some of the metabolic defects of CD and other mitochondrial diseases.",0
"Due to the high sugar content of Mopan persimmon, which has an annual output of more than 0.5 million tons in China, it can be processed to make fruit wine. In this study, a strain of yeast screened from different persimmon samples was used for persimmon wine fermentation. The optimal conditions of persimmon wine fermentation were determined through single-factor experiments as follows: Yeast addition of 0.08 g/kg; a fermentation temperature of 28 °C; sucrose addition of 18%; and pectinase addition of 0.01%. Under these conditions, the alcohol content of persimmon wine reached 12.9%. The addition of pectinase during persimmon wine fermentation was found to decompose pectin at high speed, reduce the viscosity of the fermentation liquid, increase the dissolved oxygen content in the fermentation liquid, promote the growth and reproduction of yeast, and effectively convert the sugars into alcohol. After fermentation, alcohol, residual sugars, and total phenolic content with or without pectinase treatment were 12.9 and 4.4%, 2.2 and 13.4 g/L, and 738.7 and 302 µg/mL, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that compared with the mash without pectinase treatment, the mash with pectinase had a larger network structure and more pores and yeasts.",0
Preconception optimization of thyroid function in women with Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is highly recommended to prevent/reduce the risk of thyroid insufficiency at early gestation.,1
"The goal of this study was to compare the mechanical properties of experimental resin dental composites containing a conventional photoinitiating system (camphorquinone CQ and 2-(dimethylami-no)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA)) to a photoinitiator system containing 1-phenyl-1,2 propanedione (PPD) with 2-(dimethylami-no)ethyl methacrylate) or acting alone phenylbis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phosphine oxide (BAPO). The manually produced composites consisted of an organic matrix: bis-GMA (60 wt. %), TEGDMA (40 wt. %), and silanized silica filler (45 wt. %). The composites contained 0.4/0.8 wt. %, 0.8/1.6 wt. %, and 1/2 wt. % of PPD/DMAEMA and another group included 0.25, 0.5, or 1 wt. % of BAPO. Vickers hardness, microhardness (in the nanoindentation test), diametral tensile strength, and flexural strength were assessed, and CIE L* a* b* colorimetric analysis was conducted for each composite produced. The highest average Vickers hardness values were obtained for the composite containing 1 wt. % BAPO (43.73 ± 3.52 HV). There was no statistical difference in the results of diametral tensile strength for the experimental composites tested. The results of 3-point bending tests were the highest for composites containing CQ (77.3 ± 8.84 MPa). Despite the higher hardness of experimental composites including PPD or BAPO, compared with composites with CQ, the overall results indicate that the composite with CQ still represents a better solution when used as a photoinitiator system. Moreover, the composites containing PPD and DMAEMA are not promising in terms of color or mechanical properties, especially as they require significantly longer irradiation times.",0
"Surgical pleth index (SPI) monitoring is a representative objective nociception monitoring device that measures nociception using photoplethysmographic signals. It is easy to apply to patients, and the numerical calculation formula is intuitively easy to understand; therefore, its clinical interpretation is easy. Its efficacy and usefulness have been demonstrated in several studies. The SPI detects the degree of nociception during surgery under general anesthesia better than hemodynamic parameter, thereby better guiding the administration of various opioids, including remifentanil, fentanyl, and sufentanil. Compared with conventional analgesia, SPI-guided analgesia usually reduces intraoperative opioid consumption, facilitates patient recovery, and provides comparable or reduced postoperative pain and adverse events. In addition, SPI monitoring makes it possible to predict the degree of postoperative pain and analgesic requirements through the SPI values immediately before patient arousal. However, because the patient's age, effective circulating volume, posture, concomitant medication and anesthetic administration, and level of consciousness may function as confounding factors in SPI monitoring, clinicians must be careful when interpreting SPI values. In addition, as the SPI value can differ depending on the anesthetic and analgesic management or the patient's underlying disease, it is necessary to be aware of their effects and understand the advantages and disadvantages of SPI monitoring compared to other nociception monitoring devices. Overall, this review aimed to help anesthesiologists perform optimal SPI-guided analgesia in the clinical field and establish future research designs by suggesting the usefulness and limitations of SPI monitoring in perioperative pain management.",0
"Linezolid is an oxazolidin commonly related to the development of hematological toxicity, being renal clearance the major factor involved in the drug clearance. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of increased filtration rates in the incidence of linezolid-induced hematological toxicity by comparing augmented renal clearance (ARC) patients versus normal renal function patients.",1
"<i>Klebsiella michiganensis</i> is an emerging hospital-acquired bacterial pathogen. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on the antimicrobial resistance and transmission of <i>K. michiganensis</i>. Here, we characterized the microbiological and genomic features of a carbapenem-resistant <i>K. michiganensis</i> strain harboring the <i>bla</i><sub>NDM-1</sub> gene in China.",0
"A 34-year-old female who was recently placed on anti-tuberculosis medication with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and levofloxacin therapy for suspected tuberculosis reinfection presented with subjective fevers, rash, and generalized fatigue. Labs showed signs of end-organ damage with eosinophilia and leukocytosis. One day later, the patient became hypotensive with a worsening fever, and an electrocardiogram showed new diffuse ST segment elevations with an elevated troponin. An echocardiogram revealed a reduction in ejection fraction with diffuse hypokinesis, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed circumferential myocardial edema with subepicardial and pericardial inflammation. Prompt diagnosis of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome using the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction (RegiSCAR) criteria and discontinuation of therapy was initiated. Due to the hemodynamic instability of the patient, the patient was started on systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine, with the improvement of her symptoms and rash. A skin biopsy was performed, which revealed perivascular lymphocytic dermatitis, consistent with DRESS syndrome. As the patient's ejection fraction improved spontaneously with corticosteroids, the patient was discharged with oral corticosteroids, and a repeat echocardiogram showed full recovery of ejection fraction. Perimyocarditis is a rare complication of DRESS syndrome that is associated with degranulation and the release of cytotoxic agents into myocardial cells. Early discontinuation of offending agents and initiation of corticosteroids are essential to rapid recovery of ejection fraction and improved clinical outcomes. Multimodality imaging, including MRI, should be used to confirm perimyocardial involvement and guide the necessity for mechanical support or transplant. Further research should be on the mortality of DRESS syndrome with and without myocardial involvement, with an increased emphasis on cardiac evaluation in DRESS syndrome.",1
 The primary aim of this study was to examine the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines concordant low-dose aspirin (LDA) counseling and factors associated with counseling in nulliparous birthing individuals.,0
"Sulfuryl fluoride is a gas produced on a multi-ton scale for its use as a fumigant. In the last decades, it has gained interest in organic synthesis as a reagent with unique properties in terms of stability and reactivity when compared to other sulfur-based reagents. Sulfuryl fluoride has not only been used for sulfur-fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry but also encountered applications in classic organic synthesis as an efficient activator of both alcohols and phenols, forming a triflate surrogate, namely a fluorosulfonate. A long-standing industrial collaboration in our research group drove our work on the sulfuryl fluoride-mediated transformations that will be highlighted below. We will first describe recent works on metal-catalyzed transformations from aryl fluorosulfonates while emphasizing the one-pot processes from phenol derivatives. In a second section, nucleophilic substitution reactions on polyfluoroalkyl alcohols will be discussed and the value of polyfluoroalkyl fluorosulfonates in comparison to alternative triflate and halide reagents will be brought to light.",0
Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common complaint in the emergency department and achieving effective analgesia can be challenging.,1
"Described herein are studies toward the core modification of cyclic aliphatic amines using either a riboflavin/photo-irradiation approach or Cu(I) and Ag(I) to mediate the process. Structural remodeling of cyclic amines is explored through oxidative C-N and C-C bond cleavage using peroxydisulfate (persulfate) as an oxidant. Ring-opening reactions to access linear aldehydes or carboxylic acids with flavin-derived photocatalysis or Cu salts, respectively, are demonstrated. A complementary ring-opening process mediated by Ag(I) facilitates decarboxylative Csp<sup>3</sup>-Csp<sup>2</sup> coupling in Minisci-type reactions through a key alkyl radical intermediate. Heterocycle interconversion is demonstrated through the transformation of N-acyl cyclic amines to oxazines using Cu(II) oxidation of the alkyl radical. These transformations are investigated by computation to inform the proposed mechanistic pathways. Computational studies indicate that persulfate mediates oxidation of cyclic amines with concomitant reduction of riboflavin. Persulfate is subsequently reduced by formal hydride transfer from the reduced riboflavin catalyst. Oxidation of the cyclic aliphatic amines with a Cu(I) salt is proposed to be initiated by homolysis of the peroxy bond of persulfate followed by α-HAT from the cyclic amine and radical recombination to form an α-sulfate adduct, which is hydrolyzed to the hemiaminal. Investigation of the pathway to form oxazines indicates a kinetic preference for cyclization over more typical elimination pathways to form olefins through Cu(II) oxidation of alkyl radicals.",0
"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired hypercoagulable state necessitating long-term anticoagulation for secondary thrombosis prevention. Anticoagulation guidelines are predominantly based on data in high risk, triple positive patients, and favor Vitamin K antagonists over other forms of anticoagulation. The efficacy of alternative anticoagulants for secondary thrombosis prevention in low risk, single and double positive APS remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the incidence of recurrent thrombosis and major bleeding for patient with low risk APS on long-term anticoagulation. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who met revised criteria for thrombotic APS between January, 2001 and April, 2021 and received care through the Lifespan Health System. Primary outcomes included recurrent thrombosis and WHO Grades 3 and 4 major bleeding. A total of 190 patients were followed over a median duration of 3.1 years. At time of APS diagnosis, 89 patients were treated with warfarin and 59 patients with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). There were similar rates of recurrent thrombosis in low risk patients on warfarin versus DOACs (adjusted IRR 6.91; 95% CI 0.90-53.40, p = 0.064). Major bleeding events only occurred in low risk patients on warfarin (n = 8, log-rank p = 0.13). In conclusion, despite the choice of anticoagulation, patients with low risk APS had similar rates of recurrent thrombosis suggesting DOACs may be a potential treatment option for this cohort. There was a non-significant increase in major bleeding rates in low risk patients on warfarin versus DOACs. Study limitations include a retrospective study design and small event numbers.",1
"Breast cancer (BC) cells often develop multiple mechanisms of chemo- and radio-resistance during tumor progression, which is the major reason for the failure of breast cancer therapy. Targeted nanomedicines have tremendous therapeutic potential in BC treatment over their free drug counterparts. Searching for chemo- and radio-sensitizers to overcome such resistance is therefore urgently required. The goal of this study is to evaluate and compare the radio-sensitizer efficacy of amygdalin-folic acid nanoparticles (Amy-F) on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.",0
"The aim of this research work is to improve the mechanical and water-resistance properties of soy protein isolate (SPI) biofilm. In this work, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) coupling-agent modified nanocellulose was introduced into the SPI matrix in the presence of citric acid cross-linker. The presence of amino groups in APTES facilitated the formation of - cross-linked structures with soy protein. The incorporation of a citric acid cross-linker made the cross-linking process more productive, and the surface smoothness of the film was confirmed by a Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). From the study of the mechanical and thermal properties and water resistance of the film, it was confirmed that the results were highly satisfactory for the modified nanocellulose-incorporated film compared to the non-modified one. Additionally, coating of citral essential oil onto SPI nanocomposite film displayed antimicrobial properties due to the presence of various phenolic groups in the citral oil. The Tensile Strength and Young's Modulus of silane-modified nanocellulose containing film were enhanced by ∼119 % and ∼ 112 %, respectively on incorporation of 1 % APTES-modified nanocellulose. Consequently, this work is expected to offer an effective way for silylated nano-cellulose reinforcing soy protein isolate (SPI)-based bio nanocomposite films for packaging applications. As an example, we have demonstrated one of the applications as wrapping films for packing black grapes.",0

Paracetamol is commonly used for analgesia and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) treatment in preterm infants. We aimed to evaluate early neurodevelopmental outcomes of extreme preterm infants exposed to paracetamol during their neonatal admission.,1
"The incidence of clinical endometritis in dairy cows postpartum is one of the important reasons for financial losses in the dairy industry. The costs of treatment, milk losses, infertility, repeated breeding, and high annual culling rate of dairy cows present immediate losses in case of treatment failure. The commonly used therapeutic methods for clinical endometritis have not been successful nor have given definitive solutions to overcome the complications of the disease in dairy cows. Therefore, it was necessary to propose an innovative treatment program to overcome the reasons for the failure and lack of effectiveness of the treatment of clinical endometritis. This was tackled in the current study; oxytetracycline with different concentrations, oxytetracycline 5% (OTCC5%), oxytetracycline 20% (OTCC20%), and oxytetracycline 20% nanoparticles (OTC-NPs) were used for the treatment of clinical endometritis. Diagnosis of clinical endometritis was based on the assessment of high serum concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase protein, increased endometrium thickness, and intrauterine discharges with different degrees of echogenicity monitored by ultrasonography. Application of OTC-NPs revealed a decrease in serum concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α) and acute phase proteins compared to OTCC20% and OTCC5% groups. The improvement achieved by OTC-NPs may be attributed to the reduction of OTC particles into nano size which facilitates its tissue bioavailability, dispersion, penetration power to deeper tissues, and its more broad-spectrum activities. These activities were clearly apparent after the evacuation of uterine contents using a single dose of PGF2α. The OTC-NPs revealed a reduction in serum concentration of cytokines compared to OTCC20% and OTCC5% groups arranged as follows: 10.11, 25.45, 35.56 for IL-1; 99, 300, 319 for IL-6; 1.01, 4.40, 8.06 for CRP; and 46, 183, 266 for TNF-α. Furthermore, an increase in serum concentration of albumin (3.34) was obtained by OTC-NPs compared to OTCC5% (1.70). This improvement can be taken as evidence of liver resumption functions and inflammatory reactions. On the other side, globulin concentration recorded an increase like albumin and total proteins in OTC-NPs compared to others. A reduction in the endometrium thickness in OTC-NPs with the disappearance of intrauterine discharges was monitored by ultrasonography. This confirmed the subsiding of clinical endometritis in OTC-NPs group. Moreover, a significant improvement in conception and pregnancy rate in OTC-NPs compared to other groups were observed.",0
"The development of sustainable and eco-friendly leather industry requires green tanning agents because of unbounded chromium (easily converted into hazardous Cr-VI) in chrome tanned leather. In this study, a chrome-free tanning agent (OS-LDHs) was established by integrating layered double hydroxide (magnesium aluminum zirconium hydrotalcite, LDHs) with starch derivatives. A series of oxidized starch (OS) were prepared as masking agents for LDHs tanning process. Among them, the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 1685 g/mol could be reached, which will promise the well-distribution of OS. The SEM and EDS analysis confirmed the uniform penetration of OS-LDHs, avoiding accumulation on the surface of crust leather. Notably, leather tanned by OS-LDHs achieved shrinkage temperature of 66.7 °C, porosity of 75.51 % and tear strength of 66.7 N/mm. Not only the hydrogen bond but also the coordination between NH<sub>2</sub>, COOH in collagen and OS-2-LDHs improved the thermal stability of leather without destroying the collagen triple helix.",0
"Propofol is the most commonly used intravenous general anesthetic in clinical anesthesia, and it is also widely used in general anesthesia for pregnant women and infants. Some clinical and preclinical studies have found that propofol causes damage to the immature nervous system, which may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive dysfunction in infants and children. However, its potential molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have found that some exogenous drugs and interventions can effectively alleviate propofol-induced neurotoxicity. In this review, we focus on the relevant preclinical studies and summarize the latest findings on the potential mechanisms and therapeutic strategies of propofol-induced developmental neurotoxicity.",0

"Central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis (TB) is a devastating and often life-threatening disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Contezolid, a new oxazolidinone, has demonstrated potent antimycobacterial activity in both in-vivo and in-vitro studies, with lower toxicity than linezolid. However, pharmacokinetic data are still not available for contezolid in the CNS of patients with CNS TB. This article reports the steady-state concentrations of contezolid in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a patient receiving contezolid as part of multi-drug treatment for tuberculous meningoencephalitis. At weeks 7 and 11 (7 h post-dose) after initiation of contezolid therapy, the serum concentrations of contezolid were 9.64 mg/L and 9.36 mg/L, respectively. In CSF, the observed concentrations of contezolid were 0.54 mg/L and 1.15 mg/L, respectively. The CSF:serum concentration ratios were 0.056 and 0.123 at weeks 7 and 11, respectively. The observed concentrations in CSF were above the minimum inhibitory concentration of contezolid against M. tuberculosis, and were close to the estimated serum unbound fraction of contezolid (10%), suggesting that unbound contezolid has high CSF permeability.",1
"This study investigates the triple combination of adjuvants (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)-aspirin-prednisolone) whether it improves the live birth rates of IVF&ICSI patients with previous implantation failure. This retrospective study included 1095 patients with >2 failed either fresh or frozen single embryo transfer cycles between 2014 Jan and 2021 Jan. Patients were divided into two subgroups. Group A consisted of patients with only vaginal progesterone for luteal phase support. Group B consisted of patients with triple (daily subcutaneous LMWH, daily 150 mg aspirin, and daily 16 mg prednisolone) luteal phase supplementation to vaginal progesterone. Demographic parameters, cycle characteristics, embryology, and pregnancy outcomes were compared, and the study's primary outcome was the live birth rate. Demographic parameters were similar between the groups. Positive b-hCG, miscarriage, and live birth rates were similar between groups as Group A vs. Group B, positive b-hCG 30.8% (190/617) vs. 35.4% (169/478), miscarriage rates 4.4% (27/617) vs. 6.7% (32/478), and live birth rates 20.4% (126/617) vs. 23.8% (114/478), respectively. When patients were stratified according to previous failures, live birth rates were still similar. Pregnancy outcomes were significantly improved in only patients with diminished ovarian reserve (Group A vs. Group B, positive b-hCG 24.2% vs. 34.3%, live birth rate 12.1% vs. 21.9%, p < 0.01). Whether the embryo transfer was fresh or frozen-thawed did not affect the results. A combined supplementation of LMWH, aspirin, and prednisolone in the luteal phase does not improve live birth rates of IVF&ICSI patients with previous implantation failure except potentially for patients with diminished ovarian reserve.",1
"The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkane is one of the most attractive routes in alkane production because of its favourable thermodynamic characteristic. Nitrogen-doped nanocarbons have demonstrated great potential in this reaction due to its cost-effective, high catalytic activity and stability. However, the influence of nitrogen on the catalytic properties of carbon materials is poorly understood due to the complexities of surface oxygen and nitrogen functional groups. Here we derive the performance descriptor that account for the nitrogen-dependent carbocatalysis in ODH reaction. To achieve this, we designed a set of nitrogen-doped nanocarbon materials with tunable nitrogen species by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) treatment of the biomass folic acid (FA), which are applied in ODH of ethylbenzene. Among them, FA-180-1000 catalyst can achieve high ethylbenzene conversion (up to ∼62 %) and styrene selectivity (∼87 %), outperforming other HTC carbon-based catalysts. Structural characterizations and kinetic analyses revealed that nitrogen doping strongly interferes the charge polarization of CO site via electron transfer between CO, and nitrogen (mainly pyridine nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen) thus enhancing the reactivity of CO. Furthermore, the induction period during reaction process can be shortened by applying of sulfuric acid-assisted HTC method for constructing nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst with low crystallinity. The present work provides new insights into the contribution of nitrogen doping to the ODH reaction of carbon nanocatalysts, as well as guidance for the rational design of carbon catalysts for the conversion of hydrocarbons to high-value chemicals.",0

"Over the last years, <i>Sideritis</i> extracts were shown to improve memory. However, their potential to promote the generation of new neurons, starting with the neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells, remains unexplored. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the neurogenic effects of different <i>Sideritis</i> infusions in neural stem and precursor cells and their impact on cell viability. Moreover, the metabolic fingerprints were recorded using LC-DAD, LC-HRESIMS, and GC-MS. The neurogenic potential of infusions of the eight <i>Sideritis</i> taxa tested was as potent as the classical neuronal inducer combination of retinoic acid and valproic acid. Further cytotoxicity assays revealed that the IC<sub>50</sub> values of the extracts were between 163 and 322 µg/mL. Hierarchical cluster analyses of the metabolic fingerprints unveiled that the two <i>Sideritis</i> taxa with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> values were the most divergent in the analytical techniques used. As the analysis focused on polyphenols, it is reasonable to assume that these compounds are responsible for the effect on the cell viability of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. This study is the first report on the neurogenic potential of <i>Sideritis</i> taxa and might support the use of <i>Sideritis</i> herbal preparations in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.",0

"We have previously demonstrated that excessive anticoagulation with warfarin or dabigatran may result in acute kidney injury with red blood cell (RBC) tubular casts in some patients with chronic kidney disease, and this condition was named anticoagulant-related nephropathy (ARN). 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6NE) rats treated with warfarin or dabigatran reproduce the main pathologic features of human ARN. We had reported that 5/6NE C57BL/6 mice only partially develop ARN with increased serum creatinine and hematuria but no RBC tubular casts in the kidney.",1
"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal condition in the emergency department, and early identification of modifiable risk factors for prevention and management is highly desirable. Although gut dysbiosis is associated with a high incidence of venous thromboembolism, the role and mechanisms of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism, especially PE, remain unexplored. Here, we attempted to elucidate the benefits of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of PE using multiple antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for early intervention in a classical mouse model of PE. The results showed that early administration of various antibiotics (except ampicillin) could inhibit pulmonary thrombosis to a certain extent and reduced mortality in young and old mice with PE. Among them, vancomycin has the best inhibitory effect on PE. With the help of gut microbiota sequencing analysis, we found that antibiotic treatment can reshape the gut microbiota; especially vancomycin can significantly improve the gut microbiota structure in PE mice. Furthermore, FMT could transfer vancomycin-modified gut microbes into mice and inhibit the pathogenesis of PE, possibly due to increased intestinal colonization by Parasutterella. These data elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism by which early administration of vancomycin can remodel the gut microbiota to suppress PE, providing new clues for clinical optimization and development of PE prevention strategies.",0

"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be used in canine mast cell tumours (MCTs) to optimise surgical margins or to enable marginal excision in challenging locations. The objective of this study was to describe the outcome of dogs with cutaneous and subcutaneous MCTs treated with neoadjuvant vinblastine-prednisolone (NA-VP). Records of treatment-naïve dogs with cutaneous/subcutaneous MCT that received NA-VP were reviewed including signalment, indication for NA-VP, staging results, clinical response, surgical data and histopathology reports. For dogs with post-operative follow-up ≥365 days, predictive factors for local recurrence (LR) were evaluated. Forty-four dogs were included. NA-VP was indicated to optimise surgical margins (group MARG) in 19 dogs (43.2%) and to enable surgery (group MORB) in 25 dogs (56.8%). Complete and partial response were documented in 40.9% of dogs and 30 dogs (68.2%) underwent surgery. The indication for NA-VP was significantly associated with undergoing surgery (p < .001) on multivariable analysis. Twelve (48%) and 18 dogs (94.7%) underwent surgery in the group MORB and MARG, respectively. Five dogs (16.7%) experienced wound dehiscence. Complete excision was achieved in 14 dogs (46.7%). In dogs undergoing surgery with ≥365 days of follow-up, LR was documented in five cases (20.8%). None of the factors analysed including mitotic count, completeness of excision and response to NA-VP were associated with LR; notably, LR occurred in 3/11 (27.2%) completely excised MCTs. In a pre-operative setting, NA-VP appears safe and could be beneficial in selected cases. Prognostic factors such as clinical response, mitotic count and completeness of excision should be interpreted with caution following NA-VP.",0

"Polypharmacy has become a major health issue for pregnant woman due to the increased trend of medication use during pregnancy. However, data on medication use in pregnancy are limited since pregnant women are rarely included in clinical trials. Our study aimed to investigate the trends of and characteristics associated with polypharmacy among pregnant women in the US. This study was conducted using data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the US. Nine The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles between 1999 and 2016 were used to identify pregnant women aged 15 to 44 years. Polypharmacy was defined as more than 1 medication prescription used during pregnancy. Descriptive statistics were used to report the prevalence and trends of polypharmacy. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate characteristics associated with polypharmacy among US pregnant women. Among 3,350,983 US pregnant women, about 7.4% of them (247,525) experienced polypharmacy. The prevalence of polypharmacy increased from 2.8% (1999-2000) to 10.0% (2015-2016) (P < .01) over-the time period examined in this study. Pregnant women were less likely to have experienced polypharmacy than were nonpregnant women (7.4% vs 23.5%, P < .01). Levothyroxine and albuterol were 2 prescriptions commonly taken by pregnant women. Pregnant women who were non-Hispanic white (P < .05) or had asthma (P < .05) or diabetes (P < .01) were more likely to report polypharmacy. Regarding personal characteristics, women with a poor or fair self-reported general health condition (odds ratio: 5.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-21.34) and those with chronic conditions (odds ratio: 6.91, 95% confidence interval: 3.08-15.50) were found to be associated with polypharmacy. An increased trend of polypharmacy was found in the US from 1999 to 2016. Non-Hispanic white pregnant women with a poor health status and chronic diseases were at an increased risk of polypharmacy.",1

"Spontaneous preterm birth is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Tocolytics are drugs used in cases of imminent preterm birth to inhibit uterine contractions. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocking agent used to delay threatened spontaneous preterm birth, however, has limited efficacy and lacks preclinical data regarding mechanisms of action. It is unknown if nifedipine affects the pro-inflammatory environment associated with preterm labour pathophysiology and we hypothesise nifedipine only targets myometrial contraction rather than also mitigating inflammation. We assessed anti-inflammatory and anti-contractile effects of nifedipine on human myometrium using in vitro and ex vivo techniques, and a mouse model of preterm birth. We show that nifedipine treatment inhibited contractions in myometrial in vitro contraction assays (P = 0.004 vs. vehicle control) and potently blocked spontaneous and oxytocin-induced contractions in ex vivo myometrial tissue in muscle myography studies (P = 0.01 vs. baseline). Nifedipine treatment did not reduce gene expression or protein secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in either cultured myometrial cells or ex vivo tissues. Although nifedipine could delay preterm birth in some mice, this was not consistent in all dams and was overall not statistically significant. Our data suggests nifedipine does not modulate preterm birth via inflammatory pathways in the myometrium, and this may account for its limited clinical efficacy.",1

"After skin injury, wound repair involves a complex process in which angiogenesis plays a crucial role. Previous research has indicated that fucoidan may aid in wound healing; we therefore hypothesised that fucoidan may speed up the process by promoting angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the potential molecular mechanism underlying fucoidan's ability to accelerate wound healing by promoting angiogenesis. Using a full-cut wound model, we observed that fucoidan significantly intensified wound closure and promoted granulation formation and collagen deposition. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that fucoidan also promoted wound angiogenesis, specifically by accelerating the migration of new blood vessels to the middle area of the wound. Furthermore, fucoidan demonstrated the ability to enhance the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) damaged by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) and to improve the formation of endothelial tubes. Mechanistic studies revealed that fucoidan upregulated the protein levels of the AKT/Nrf2/HIF-1α signalling pathway, which plays a crucial role in angiogenesis. This was further confirmed using the inhibitor LY294002, which reversed the promotion of endothelial tube formation by fucoidan. Overall, our findings suggest that fucoidan can promote angiogenesis via the AKT/Nrf2/HIF-1α signalling pathway and accelerate wound healing.",0
"A new counterion-induced small-molecule micelle (SM) with surface charge-switchable activities for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections is proposed. The amphiphilic molecule formed by zwitterionic compound and the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP), via a ""mild salifying reaction"" of the amino and benzoic acid groups, can spontaneously assemble into counterion-induced SMs in water. Through vinyl groups designed on zwitterionic compound, the counterion-induced SMs could be readily cross-linked using mercapto-3, 6-dioxoheptane by click reaction, to create pH-sensitive cross-linked micelles (CSMs). Mercaptosuccinic acid was also decorated on the CSMs (DCSMs) by the same click reaction to afford charge-switchable activities, resulting in CSMs that were biocompatible with red blood cells and mammalian cells in normal tissues (pH 7.4), while having strong retention to negatively charged bacterial surfaces at infection sites, based on electrostatic interaction (pH 5.5). As a result, the DCSMs could penetrate deep into bacterial biofilms and then release drugs in response to the bacterial microenvironment, effectively killing the bacteria in the deeper biofilm. The new DCSMs have several advantages such as robust stability, a high drug loading content (∼ 30%), easy fabrication, and good structural control. Overall, the concept holds promise for the development of new products for clinical application. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We fabricated a new counterion-induced small-molecule micelle with surface charge-switchable activities (DCSMs) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Compared with reported covalent systems, the DCSMs not only have improved stability, high drug loading content (∼ 30%), and good biosafety, but also have the environmental stimuli response, and antibacterial activity of the original drugs. As a result, the DCSMs exhibited enhanced antibacterial activities against MRSA both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the concept holds promise for the development of new products for clinical application.",0
"The effects of three different hulling methods wiz natural heaping/traditional (T1), steeping (T2), and spraying (T3), on moisture, colour, fat, free amino acids, fatty acids, antioxidant activities, flavonoids, tannins, total phenolic content, and organoleptic qualities of walnut kernels were examined in this study. The kernels extracted from walnuts subjected to T3 method recorded significantly (p ≤ 0.05) highest DPPH inhibition (68.61 %), ABTS (54.56 %inhibition) and FRAP (0.106 μM trolox/100 g); flavonoids (1993.08 mg QE/100 g), tannin content (0.312 %) and phenols (0.736 mg GAE/g) compared to T1 and T2. Walnut kernels of T3 treatment group were rated better in terms of taste (3.8), odour (3.6) and overall acceptability (3.78) Furthermore, walnut kernels obtained from T3 treatment group exhibited the highest percentage of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) and sweet free amino acids. The outcome of the present study offers a fresh viewpoint regarding the hulling processes of green walnuts to meet the quality requirements of walnut kernels.",0
"Analysis of volume-limited biological samples such as single cells and biofluids not only benefits clinical purposes but also promotes fundamental research in life sciences. Detection of these samples, however, imposes strict requirements on measurement performance because of the minimal volume and concentrated salts of the samples. Herein, we developed a self-cleaning nanoelectrospray ionization device powered by a pocket-size ""MasSpec Pointer"" (MSP-nanoESI) for metabolic analysis of salty biological samples with limited volume. The self-cleaning effect induced by Maxwell-Wagner electric stress helps with keeping the borosilicate glass capillary tip free from clogging and thus increasing salt tolerance. This device possesses a high sample economy (about 0.1 μL per test) due to its pulsed high voltage supply, sampling method (dipping the nanoESI tip into analyte solution), and contact-free electrospray ionization (ESI) (the electrode does not touch the analyte solution during ESI). High repeatable results could be acquired by the device with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.02% for voltage output and 12.94% for MS signals of caffeine standard. Single MCF-7 cells were metabolically analyzed directly from phosphate buffered saline, and two types of untreated cerebrospinal fluid from hydrocephalus patients were distinguished with 84% accuracy. MSP-nanoESI gets rid of the bulky apparatus and could be held in hand or put into one's pocket for transportation, and it could operate for more than 4 h without recharge. We believe this device will boost scientific research and clinical usage of volume-limited biological samples with high-concentration salts in a low-cost, convenient, and rapid manner.",0
"Sibling female and male Chihuahuas were evaluated for a 9-month history of tachypnea that failed to respond to fenbendazole, doxycycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and prednisone. Physical examination identified tachypnea, hyperpnea, and harsh bronchovesicular lung sounds. Fundic examination disclosed diffuse chorioretinitis, manifested as multifocal chorioretinal granulomas in the female dog and occasional chorioretinal scars in the male dog. Thoracic radiographs indicated moderate to severe interstitial to broncho-interstitial infiltrates in both dogs. Serum and urine antigen and antibody testing in the female dog failed to identify infectious agents, but cytologic assessment of hepatic lymph node, liver, and splenic aspirates identified Pneumocystis trophozoites. Infection was confirmed in both dogs by 28S rRNA PCR sequencing from multiple tissue samples. The female dog responded well to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but the male dog was euthanized because of liver failure, presumably related to antimicrobial treatment.",1

"Low-cost stainless-steel electrodes can activate hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) by converting it into a hydroxyl radical (<sup>•</sup>OH) and other reactive oxidants. At an applied potential of +0.020 V, the stainless-steel electrode produced <sup>•</sup>OH with a yield that was over an order of magnitude higher than that reported for other systems that employ iron oxides as catalysts under circumneutral pH conditions. Decreasing the applied potential at pH 8 and 9 enhanced the rate of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> loss by shifting the process to a reaction mechanism that resulted in the formation of an Fe(IV) species. Significant metal leaching was only observed under acidic pH conditions (i.e., at pH <6), with the release of dissolved Fe and Cr occurring as the thickness of the passivation layer decreased. Despite the relatively high yield of <sup>•</sup>OH production under circumneutral pH conditions, most of the oxidants were scavenged by the electrode surface when contaminant concentrations comparable to those expected in drinking water sources were tested. The stainless-steel electrode efficiently removed trace organic contaminants from an authentic surface water sample without contaminating the water with Fe and Cr. With further development, stainless-steel electrodes could provide a cost-effective alternative to other H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activation processes, such as those by ultraviolet light.",0
"In this study the influence of an enantiomeric co-former and the preparation method on the solid-state properties and physical stability of co-amorphous systems were investigated. Co-amorphous systems consisting of indomethacin (IND) and chiral tryptophan (TRP) as co-former in its two enantiomeric forms, as racemate, and as conglomerate (equimolar mixture of D- and L-TRP) were prepared. Co-amorphization was achieved by ball milling (BM) and spray drying (SD). The effects of chirality and preparation method on the solid-state properties and physical stabilities of the systems were investigated by XRPD, FTIR and mDSC. Differences in the BM process were caused by the enantiomeric properties of the co-former: The IND/TRP conglomerate (IND/TRPc) turned co-amorphous after 60 min. In contrast, co-amorphization of IND/L-TRP and IND/D-TRP required 80 min of ball milling, respectively, and the co-amorphous IND/TRP racemate (IND/TRPr) was obtained only after 90 min of ball milling. Although the intermolecular interactions of the co-amorphous systems prepared by BM and SD were similar (determined by FTIR), the T<sub>g</sub> values differed (∼87 °C for the ball milled and ∼62 °C for the spray dried systems). The physical stabilities of the ball milled co-amorphous systems varied between 3 and 11 months if stored at elevated temperature and dry conditions, with the highest stability for the IND/TRPc system and the lowest stability for the IND/TRPr system, and these differences correlated with the calculated relaxation times. In contrast, all spray dried systems were stable only for 1 month and their relaxation times were similar. It could be shown that the chirality of a co-former and the preparation method influence the solid-state properties, thermal properties and physical stability of IND/TRP systems.",0

"Understanding the non-covalent interactions in host-guest complexes is crucial to their stability, design and applications. Here, we use density functional theory to compare the ability of β-cyclodextrin (<b>β-CD</b>) and heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-β-cyclodextrin (<b>DM-β-CD</b>) to encapsulate the model guest phenol. For both macrocycles, we quantify the intramolecular interactions before and after the formation of the complex, as well as the intermolecular host-guest and host-host dimer interactions. These are individually classified as van der Waals interactions or hydrogen bonds, respectively. The results show a stronger intramolecular binding energy of <b>β-CD</b>, with the absolute difference being -5.53 kcal/mol relative to <b>DM-β-CD</b>. Consequently, the intermolecular interactions of both cyclodextrins with phenol are affected, such that the free binding energy calculated for the <b>DM-β-CD</b>/phenol complex (-5.23 kcal/mol) is ≈50% more negative than for the complex with <b>β-CD</b> (-2.62 kcal/mol). The latter is in excellent agreement with the experimental data (-2.69 kcal/mol), which validates the level of theory (B97-3c) used. Taken together, the methylation of <b>β-CD</b> increases the stability of the host-guest complex with the here studied guest phenol through stronger van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. We attribute this to the disruption of the hydrogen bond network in the primary face of <b>β-CD</b> upon methylation, which influences the flexibility of the host toward the guest as well as the strength of the intermolecular interactions. Our work provides fundamental insights into the impact of different non-covalent interactions on host-guest stability, and we suggest that this theoretical framework can be adapted to other host-guest complexes to evaluate and quantify their non-covalent interactions.",0
"In this report, we present our results on the recognition of multiple analytes using trisubstituted PDI-based chemosensors DNP and DNB in 50% HEPES buffered-CH<sub>3</sub>CN solution. Upon the addition of Hg<sup>2+</sup>, DNB showed a decrease and increase in absorbance intensity at 560 and 590 nm, respectively, with a detection limit of 7.17 μM and bleaching of the violet color (de-butynoxy). Similarly, the addition of Fe<sup>2+</sup> or H<sub>2</sub>S to the solution of DNP or DNB resulted in ratiometric changes (<i>A</i><sub>688nm</sub>/<i>A</i><sub>560nm</sub>) with respective detection limits of 185 nM and 27.6 nM for Fe<sup>2+</sup>, respectively, and a color change from violet to green. However, the addition of >37 μM H<sub>2</sub>S caused a decrease in absorbance at 688 nm with a concomitant blue shift to 634 nm. Upon the addition of dopamine, the DNP + Fe<sup>2+</sup> assay showed ratiometric (<i>A</i><sub>560nm</sub>/<i>A</i><sub>688nm</sub>) changes within 10 s along with a color change from green to violet. Moreover, DNP has been successfully used for the exogenous detection of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in A549 cells. Further, the multiple outputs observed with DNP in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>S have been used to construct NOR, XOR, INH and 4-to-2 encoder logic gates and circuits.",0

"Fentanyl and its analogues are potent synthetic opioids that are commonly abused and are currently the number one cause of drug overdose death in the United States. The ability to detect fentanyl with simple, rapid, and low-cost tools is crucial for forensics, medical care, and public safety. Conventional on-site testing options for fentanyl detection─including chemical spot tests, lateral-flow immunoassays, and portable Raman spectrometers─each have their own unique flaws that limit their analytical utility. Here, we have developed a series of new aptamer-based assays and sensors that can detect fentanyl as well as several of its analogues in a reliable, accurate, rapid, and economic manner. These include colorimetric, fluorescent, and electrochemical sensors, which can detect and quantify minute quantities of fentanyl and many of its analogues with no response to other illicit drugs, cutting agents, or adulterants─even in interferent-ridden binary mixtures containing as little as 1% fentanyl. Given the high performance of these novel analytical tools, we foresee the potential for routine use by medical and law enforcement personnel as well as the general public to aid in rapid and accurate fentanyl identification.",0
"Pregnant women are at a high risk of contracting listeriosis; however, there have been only a few clinical reports of maternal bacteremia occurring before 20 weeks of gestation in China. In this case report, a 28-year-old pregnant woman at 16 weeks and 4 days of gestation was admitted to our hospital suffering from fever for four days. The patient was initially diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection at the local community hospital; nevertheless, the cause of the infection was unknown. In our hospital, she was diagnosed with <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> (<i>L. monocytogenes</i>) infection by the blood culture system. Before the results of blood culture were obtained, ceftriaxone and cefazolin were given for three days respectively based on clinical experience. However, the fever didn't reduce until she was treated with ampicillin. This pathogen was further identified as <i>L. monocytogenes</i> ST87 by serotyping, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and virulence gene amplification. Finally, a healthy baby boy was born in our hospital, and the neonate was developing well at the 6-week postnatal follow-up visit. This case report suggests that patients with <i>L. monocytogenes</i> ST87-caused maternal listeriosis can have a good prognosis; however, more clinical information and molecular experiments are needed to confirm our hypothesis.",1
"To quantify the association between opioid agonist treatment (OAT) and overdose death by age group; test the hypothesis that across different age groups, opioid overdose mortality is lowest during OAT with buprenorphine compared with time out of treatment or OAT with methadone; and test associations between OAT and opioid overdose mortality in the presence of chronic circulatory, respiratory, liver and kidney diseases.",1
"Recent improvements in 3D printing technology have increased the usage of 3D printed materials in several areas. An exciting and emerging area of applying these next-generation manufacturing strategies is the development of devices for biomedical applications. The main aim of this work was to investigate the effect of tannic acid, gallic acid, and epicatechin gallate on the physicochemical characteristics of acrylonitrile butadiene-styrene (ABS) and Nylon 3D printing materials using the contact angle method. The adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus on untreated and treated materials was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis and the images were treated by MATLAB software. The results of the contact angle measurements showed a significant change in the physicochemical properties of both surfaces, indicated an increase in the electron donor character of 3D printing materials following treatment. Thus, the ABS surfaces treated with tannic acid, gallic acid, and epicatechin gallate have become more electron donating. Furthermore, our results proved the ability of S. aureus to adhere on all materials with a percentage of 77.86% for ABS and 91.62% for nylon. The SEM has shown that all actives molecules were sufficient to obtain better inhibition of bacterial adhesion, which tannic acid has shown a total inhibition of S. aureus on ABS. From these results, our treatment presents a high potential for utilization as an active coating to prevent bacterial attachment and the eventual biofilm development in medical field.",0

"Although an increasing number of real-life data confirm large-scale clinical trial findings on the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, rare but severe adverse reactions have begun to emerge. Here, we report a full-blown hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) following a BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccine. A 48-year-old man developed, 5 days after the first shot of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, erythematous and painful nodular lesions in the lower and upper limbs accompanied by widespread itching, acrocyanosis with gangrenous lesions at the tips of the first and fourth fingers of the right hand, as well as paresthesia in the right hand and foot. Investigations revealed isolated eosinophilia, occlusion of the right ulnar artery, and electromyography alteration compatible with multifocal sensory neuropathy, as well as minimal accentuation of the interstitial texture with some ground glass appearance. Despite treatment with prednisone in combination with warfarin, he developed thrombosis of the left ulnar artery. Therefore, therapy with an IL-5 inhibitor and acetylsalicylic was successfully added. Given the time interval between the onset of clinical manifestations and the vaccine shot, we believe that the mRNA vaccine triggered the eosinophilic response. This case evidences a possible link between HES and the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Mepolizumab, an IL-5 inhibitor, might be considered in steroid refractory cases.",0
"<i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> is an obligate intracellular bacterium that is responsible for the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections. Changes in DNA topology in this pathogen have been linked to its pathogenicity-associated developmental cycle. Here, evidence is provided that the balanced activity of DNA topoisomerases (Topos) contributes to <i>Chlamydia</i> developmental processes. Utilizing catalytically inactivated Cas12 (dCas12) based-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) technology, we demonstrate targeted knockdown of chromosomal <i>topA</i> transcription in <i>C. trachomatis</i> without detected toxicity of dCas12. Repression of <i>topA</i> impaired the growth of <i>C. trachomatis</i> mostly through disruption of its differentiation from a replicative form to an infectious form. Consistent with this, expression of late developmental genes of <i>C. trachomatis</i> was downregulated while early genes maintained their expression. Importantly, the growth defect associated with <i>topA</i> knockdown was rescued by overexpressing <i>topA</i> at an appropriate degree and time, directly linking the growth patterns to the levels of <i>topA</i> expression. Interestingly, <i>topA</i> knockdown had pleiotropic effects on DNA gyrase expression, indicating a potential compensatory mechanism for survival to offset TopA deficiency. <i>C. trachomatis</i> with <i>topA</i> knocked down displayed hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin that targets DNA gyrase in comparison with the wild type. These data underscore the requirement of integrated topoisomerase actions to support the essential development and transcriptional processes of <i>C. trachomatis</i> .",1
"Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death and its promotion in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) attenuates liver fibrosis. Statins, which are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, may induce ferroptosis via the downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway. However, little evidence is available regarding the association between statins and ferroptosis. Therefore, we investigated the association between statins and ferroptosis in HSCs.",1
"Heavy metal pollution, including that caused by cadmium (Cd), is a matter of increasing concern. Although in situ passivation remediation has been widely used to treat heavy metal-polluted soils, most studies have focused on acidic soils, while studies on alkaline soil conditions are scarce. In this study, the effects of biochar (BC), phosphate rock powder (PRP), and humic acid (HA) on Cd<sup>2+</sup> adsorption were examined alone and in combination to choose an appropriate Cd passivation approach for weakly alkaline soils. Additionally, the combined impact of passivation on Cd availability, plant Cd absorption, plant physiology indexes, and soil microbial community was elucidated. BC had a higher Cd adsorption capacity and removal rate than those of PRP and HA. Moreover, HA and PRP enhanced the adsorption capacity of BC. A combination of biochar and humic acid (BHA), and biochar and phosphate rock powder (BPRP) significantly affected soil Cd passivation. BHA and BPRP decreased the plant Cd content and soil Cd-DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) by 31.36 %, 20.80 %, 38.19 %, and 41.26 %, respectively; however, they increased the fresh weight by 65.64-71.48 % respectively, and dry weight by 62.41-71.35 %, respectively. Notably, only BPRP increased the node and root tip number in wheat. Total protein (TP) content increased in BHA and BPRP, with BHA showing lower TP than BPRP. BHA and BPRP showed a reduction in glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and peroxidase (POD); BHA showed a significantly lower GSH than BPRP. Additionally, BHA and BPRP increased soil sucrase, alkaline phosphatase, and urease activities, with BPRP showing considerably higher enzyme activity than BHA. Both BHA and BPRP increased the number of soil bacteria, altered the community composition, and critical metabolic pathways. The results demonstrated that BPRP could be used as a highly effective, novel passivation technique for the remediation of Cd-contaminated soil.",0
"Globally, the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) is increasing, and the resulting zoster-associated pain (ZAP) severely affects the quality of life of patients. Therefore, active treatment of ZAP and prevention of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) are very important for patients in the early stage of the disease. This retrospective observational study aimed to evaluate the effect of CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) combined with ozone injection on zoster-associated pain.",1
"This work presents the history of the recognition of principal regulatory capacities of estrogen hormones having been mistakenly regarded as breast cancer promoting agents for more than 120 years. Comprehensive analysis of the results of clinical, epidemiological, immunological and molecular studies justified that endogenous estrogens are the principal regulators of embryonic development, survival and reproduction <i>via</i> orchestrating appropriate expression and even edition of all genes in mammalians. Medical use of chemically modified synthetic estrogens caused toxic complications; thromboembolic events and increased cancer risk in female organs as they proved to be endocrine disruptors deregulating estrogen receptors (ERs) rather than their activators. Synthetic estrogen treatment exhibits ambiguous correlations with cancer risk at different sites, which may be attributed to an inhibition of the unliganded activation of estrogen receptors (ERs) coupled with compensatory liganded activation. The principle of estrogen induced breast cancer led to the introduction of antiestrogen therapies against this tumor; inhibition of the liganded activation of estrogen receptors and aromatase enzyme activity. The initial enthusiasm turned into disappointment as the majority of breast cancers proved to be primarily resistant to antiestrogens. In addition, nearly all patients showing earlier good tumor responses to endocrine therapy, later experienced secondary resistance leading to metastatic disease and fatal outcome. Studying the molecular events in tumors responsive and unresponsive to antiestrogen therapy, it was illuminated that a complete inhibition of liganded ER activation stimulates the growth of cancers, while a successful compensatory upregulation of estrogen signal may achieve DNA restoration, tumor regression and patient's survival. Recognition of the principal role of endogenous estrogens in gene expression, gene edition and DNA repair, estrogen treatment and stimulation of ER expression in patients may bring about a great turn in medical practice.",1
"Use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl increased ~300% in the last decade, including among women of reproductive ages. Adverse neonatal outcomes and long-term behavioral disruptions are associated with perinatal opioid exposure. Our previous work demonstrated that perinatal fentanyl exposed mice displayed enhanced negative affect and somatosensory circuit and behavioral disruptions during adolescence. However, little is known about molecular adaptations across brain regions that underlie these outcomes. We performed RNA sequencing across three reward and two sensory brain areas to study transcriptional programs in perinatal fentanyl exposed juvenile mice. Pregnant dams received 10 μg/ml fentanyl in the drinking water from embryonic day 0 (E0) through gestational periods until weaning at postnatal day 21 (P21). RNA was extracted from nucleus accumbens (NAc), prelimbic cortex (PrL), ventral tegmental area (VTA), somatosensory cortex (S1) and ventrobasal thalamus (VBT) from perinatal fentanyl exposed mice of both sexes at P35. RNA sequencing was performed, followed by analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene co-expression networks. Transcriptome analysis revealed DEGs and gene modules significantly associated with exposure to perinatal fentanyl in a sex-wise manner. The VTA had the most DEGs, while robust gene enrichment occurred in NAc. Genes enriched in mitochondrial respiration were pronounced in NAc and VTA of perinatal fentanyl exposed males, extracellular matrix (ECM) and neuronal migration enrichment were pronounced in NAc and VTA of perinatal fentanyl exposed males, while genes associated with vesicular cycling and synaptic signaling were markedly altered in NAc of perinatal fentanyl exposed female mice. In sensory areas from perinatal fentanyl exposed females, we found alterations in mitochondrial respiration, synaptic and ciliary organization processes. Our findings demonstrate distinct transcriptomes across reward and sensory brain regions, with some showing discordance between sexes. These transcriptome adaptations may underlie structural, functional, and behavioral changes observed in perinatal fentanyl exposed mice.",1
"Donkey milk (DM) is a source of bioactive compounds that can benefit neural functioning. In the present study, we investigated the effects of DM consumption on anxiolytic-related, despair-like, locomotion and coordination behaviors, as well as the provision of protection from oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in brain tissues and melatonin plasma levels. To achieve this, male mice orally received DM (4 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>) or vehicle for 18 days. Their behavior was assessed in the following tests: elevated plus maze (EPM), open field and rotarod tests (OF, RR) and forced swimming test (FST). Acute treatments with diazepam (DZP, 1.5 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>, v.o.), fluoxetine (FLX, 20 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>, i.p.) and nortriptyline (NTP, 20 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>, i.p.) were used as positive controls. On the eighteenth day, the animals were euthanized and brain tissue and blood were collected to measure oxidative damage, and melatonin plasma levels. Similar to DZP, repeated DM consumption reduced exploration to open areas in the EPM test. Under our experimental conditions, conventional antidepressants reduced immobility time in the FST, and the benzodiazepine treatment impaired motor coordination in mice. No significant differences in locomotion, motor coordination and despair-related behaviors were observed in the mice treated with DM when assessed in the EPM, OF, RR and FST, respectively. Biochemical assays showed that repeated DM exposition protected against oxidative damage to lipids and increased plasma levels of melatonin. These findings suggest consumption of DM may be a promising food for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders, without depressant effects on the central nervous system.",1
"Levetiracetam is a commonly used anti-seizure medication, with the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms being the most common side effect.

"The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells has opened the field of study for stem cell research, disease modeling and drug development. However, the epigenetic signatures present in somatic cells make cell reprogramming still an inefficient process. This epigenetic memory constitutes an obstacle in cellular reprogramming.

"Date palm fruit (<i>Phoenix dactylifera</i>: Arecaceae) is rich in essential nutrients and possesses several pharmacological and medicinal activities. The current study aimed to optimize a water bath-assisted extraction method for two cultivars of date palm fruits, Anbara (An) and Reziz (Rz), and investigated the protective effect of the optimized date palm fruit extract against CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver toxicity in relation to oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and DNA integrity. The optimization process of two date palm fruit cultivars was applied, using response surface methodology through adjusting three ""factors""; time, temperature, and rotation, to allow maximum contents of total phenolic (TPC), total flavonoid (TFC), reducing power (FRAP) and scavenging activity (ABTS) of the extract ""responses"". Extraction factors' application significantly enhanced TPC, TFC, FRAP, and ABTS responses by 1.30, 1.23, 3.03, and 2.06-fold, respectively in An and 2.18, 1.71, 1.11, and 2.62-fold, respectively in Rz, in relation to the convectional water extraction. Furthermore, co-administered CCl<sub>4</sub> with An or Rz optimized extracts enhanced body weight gain, amended hepatic architecture, and diminished collagen fiber accumulation. Furthermore, An or Rz extracts reduced liver enzymes, hydroxyproline, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), MDA, inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, NF-κB) levels, and DNA fragmentation, while increasing deteriorated adiponectin (ADP) and antioxidant enzyme (GSH, GPX, NO, and IFN-γ) levels, relative to CCl<sub>4</sub>-administered animals. The protective effects of An or Rz-optimized extracts were also evidenced by suppressing hepatic fibrosis and improving liver function and structure via modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, in CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced hepatic damage. Hence, the optimized extraction process for the two date palm fruits resulted in extracts which are rich in phenolic and flavonoid contents and with an elevated antioxidant power. The presence of these rich extracts could help to explain their proven hepatoprotective activity against CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver toxicity.",0
Gynecomastia is a common condition in clinical practice. The present study aimed to review the clinical data of ER-positive gynecomastia patients treated by tamoxifen (TAM) versus surgery and discussed the clinical effects of the two treatment strategies.,0
"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is the key enzyme responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins that display pro-inflammatory properties and thus, it is a potential target protein to develop anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, chemical and bio-informatics approaches have been employed to find a novel potent andrographolide (AGP) analog as a COX-2 inhibitor having better pharmacological properties than aspirin and rofecoxib (controls). The full amino acid sequenced human Alpha fold (AF) COX-2 protein (604AA) was selected and validated for its accuracy against the reported COX-2 protein structures (PDB ID: 5F19, 5KIR, 5F1A, 5IKQ and 1V0X) followed by multiple sequence alignment analysis to establish the sequence conservation. The systematic virtual screening of 237 AGP analogs against AF-COX-2 protein yielded 22 lead compounds based on the binding energy score (< - 8.0 kcal/mol). These were further screened out to 7 analogs by molecular docking analysis and investigated further for ADMET prediction, ligand efficiency metrics calculations, quantum mechanical analysis, MD simulation, electrostatic potential energy (EPE) docking simulation, and MM/GBSA. In-depth analysis revealed that AGP analog A3 (3-[2-[(1R,4aR,5R,6R,8aR)-6-hydroxy-5,6,8a-trimethyl-2-methylidene-3,4,4a,5,7,8-hexahydro-1H-naphthalen-1-yl]ethylidene]-4-hydroxyoxolan-2-one) forms the most stable complex with the AF-COX-2 showing the least RMSD value (0.37 ± 0.03 nm), a good number of hydrogen bonds (protein-ligand H-bond = 11, and protein H-bond = 525), minimum EPE score (- 53.81 kcal/mol), and lowest MM-GBSA before and after simulation (- 55.37 and - 56.25 kcal/mol, respectively) value compared to other analogs and controls. Thus, we suggest that the identified A3 AGP analog could be developed as a promising plant-based anti-inflammatory drug by inhibiting COX-2.",0
"Bioactive compounds in wheat have received a great interest in the last few years due to their nutritional and health benefits. Various analytical procedures were used to identify these compounds in wheat kernels. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) was used for the screening of bioactive compounds in seven Tunisian durum wheat extracts. The aim of this study was to realize a screening of several classes of bioactive compounds in the same analysis and to identify specific metabolite markers for discriminating the durum wheat varieties. The UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS allows the detection of 81 metabolites, belonging to different chemical families such as sugars, organic acids, amino acids, fatty acids, and phenolic compounds represented by benzoic and cinnamic acid derivatives, phenolic alcohols, flavones, lignans, and condensed tannins. Chemical profiles identified varied greatly between different wheat genotypes. As far as the authors know, this is the first time that different chemical classes were detected at the same time in durum wheat kernels using UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. This study gives the most complete map of metabolites in Tunisian durum wheat and proves that UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS coupled with chemometric analysis is a great tool for discrimination between durum wheat cultivars.",0
"Prone positioning and neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are frequently used to treat severe respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia.

"Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) is a rare, acute, and life-threatening mucocutaneous disease that occurs after the administration of certain drugs, resulting in extensive keratinocyte cell death, skin involvement at the dermal-epidermal junction, and extensive bullous skin eruptions and sloughing. Many published case reports have observed the presence of fever with a viral infection, drug, and/or genetic association as a possible trigger for TEN but associated with other comorbidities. Physicians still struggle to predict which individuals could be predisposed to TEN. The case report that we present had a history of multiple drug intake and fever due to dengue virus infection but was not associated with any other comorbidity.",1
"Anticoagulation could not be currently stopped even after successful thoracoscopic ablation of atrial fibrillation for at least 2 months. The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy outcomes between a new oral anticoagulant and warfarin after thoracoscopic ablation. This trial was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled study comparing edoxaban and warfarin in patients undergoing thoracoscopic ablation of atrial fibrillation. This study enrolled 60 patients randomly assigned into 2 groups. The primary endpoint was efficacy outcomes, including stroke and systemic thromboembolic events. The secondary endpoint was safety outcomes including major bleeding and pericarditis. The patients were evaluated at discharge, 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. No stroke and thromboembolic events were noted in both treatment groups during the follow-up period. During the 6 months follow-up period, 4 (13%) of 30 patients in the edoxaban group experienced minor bleeding events, whereas none were noted in the warfarin group. Five anticoagulation-related events (bleeding, and prolongation of international normalized ratio), including pericarditis, were noted in both the edoxaban and warfarin groups. No statistically significant difference existed between the 2 groups. In conclusion, this study showed the comparable results of edoxaban to warfarin during the window period of post-thoracoscopic ablation of atrial fibrillation. Moreover, anticoagulation-related events were rather affected by patient factors and not by the anticoagulant type.",1
"During the pandemic, some mortality-related factors were age, sex, comorbidities (obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension), recovery time, hospitalizations, and biochemical markers. The present work aimed to identify the mortality and survival factors in adults with moderate and severe pneumonia due to COVID-19 during the first and second waves of the pandemic in Mexico at a third-level hospital (High-Specialty Regional Hospital of Ixtapaluca (HRAEI), Ixtapaluca, Estado de Mexico, Mexico). A database was generated using information from the electronic clinical records of patients hospitalized from December 2021 to August 2022. Survival analysis was performed associating age, sex, longer recovery times, and some drugs. The risk factors found were age in the patients between 40 and 60 years (OR = 1.70), male sex (OR = 1.53), the presence of comorbidities (OR = 1.66) and hypertension (OR = 2.19), work occupation (construction workers OR = 5.22, factory workers OR = 3.13, unemployed OR = 2.93), the prehospital use of metamizole sodium (OR = 2.17), cough (OR = 1.73), and in-hospital oxygen therapy (reservoir mask OR = 6.6). The survival factors found in this study were working in the healthcare field (OR = 0.26), the prehospital use of certain medications (paracetamol OR = 0.65, dexamethasone OR = 0.55, and azithromycin OR = 0.47), presenting ageusia (OR = 0.5) and hyporexia (OR = 0.34), and the time using in-hospital oxygen therapy (device 1 OR = 0.72). Prehospital treatment needs to be reevaluated as dexamethasone and azithromycin proved to be protective factors. Likewise, providing aggressive oxygen therapy during hospital admission decreased mortality risk.",1
"Ageing beer in contact with wood is a common technological procedure that has been used for centuries to improve colour, structure, and certain flavours. Herein, the impact of the addition of French and American oak wood to two beer styles, pale and dark, on beer phenolic composition (total phenolics, total flavonoids, and HPLC-DAD) and bioactivity (FRAP, DPPH, anti-inflammatory activity in RAW 264.7, and antiproliferative in Caco-2 cells) was assessed. Thirteen phenolics were quantified with values according to previous reports. Dark malt resulted in higher values of total phenolics, to which m-hydroxybenzoic, syringic, p-coumaric acids, and xanthohumol contributed considerably; the exception was (+)-catechin and salicylic acid, which were found to be higher in pale beers. American oak significantly increased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, vanillic, and syringic acids up to roughly 3, 2, and 10 times, respectively, when compared with French wood. FRAP and DPPH values varied between pale and dark beers, with a less pronounced effect after wood addition. All samples presented considerable cellular antioxidant and anti-inflammatory as well as antiproliferative activity, but differences were found only for the antiproliferative activity, which was higher for the dark beers, which reached about 70% inhibition. Overall, the influence of malts was more pronounced than that of wood, in the studied conditions, highlighting the overwhelming impact of malts on the bioactivity of beer.",0
"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), also called atypical antipsychotics, are common therapies for women with a spectrum of psychiatric disorders. No systematically ascertained human reproductive safety data are available for lurasidone, and prospective data for quetiapine are limited, making decisions regarding use of these medications during pregnancy complicated. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> The National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications is a prospective cohort study designed to collect reproductive safety data relative to SGAs. Pregnant women aged 18-45 years, with psychiatric illness and prenatal psychotropic medication exposure completed three phone interviews during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Cases of presumed malformations are abstracted from medical records for adjudication by a teratologist blinded to medication exposure. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of 2,293 women enrolled at the time of analysis, 134 in the lurasidone group, 264 in the quetiapine group, and 886 controls completed the postpartum interview and were therefore eligible for inclusion. Dropped or lost-to-follow-up participants (13%) and those currently pregnant were excluded. Participants were predominantly White, college-educated, and married (lurasidone = 88.1%, 76.9%, 77.6%; quetiapine = 89.8%, 71.2%, 75.0%; controls = 92.7%, 86.7%, 89.1%). Absolute risks of major malformations were 2.19% (lurasidone), 1.85% (quetiapine), and 1.77% (controls). Odds ratios comparing lurasidone and quetiapine with controls were 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.36-4.32) and 1.04 (95% CI = 0.38-2.85), respectively. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> No specific patterns of malformations were observed in infants exposed to the medications of interest. Lurasidone and quetiapine did not appear to be major teratogens, but further information is needed to refine risk estimates. Food and Drug Administration guidance underscores the importance of pregnancy registries. Clinical trial number: NCT01246765.",1
"Extensive antibiotic use increases the environmental presence of their residues and may accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance, although this remains poorly understood at environmentally relevant concentrations. Herein, susceptible <i>Escherichia coli</i> K12 was continuously exposed to five antibiotics at such concentrations for 100 days. The <i>de novo</i>-evolved mutants rapidly obtained fluoroquinolone resistance within 10 days, as indicated by the 4- and 16-fold augmentation of minimum inhibitory concentrations against enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Moreover, the mutants maintained heritable fluoroquinolone resistance after the withdrawal of antibiotics for 30 days. Genomic analysis identified Asp87Gly or Ser83Leu substitutions in the <i>gyr</i>A gene in the mutants. Transcriptomics data showed that the transcriptional response of the mutants to fluoroquinolones was primarily involved in biofilm formation, cellular motility, porin, oxidative stress defense, and energy metabolism. Homologous recombination and molecular docking revealed that mutations of <i>gyr</i>A primarily mainly conferred fluoroquinolone resistance, while mutations at different positions of <i>gyr</i>A likely endowed different fluoroquinolone resistance levels. Collectively, this study revealed that environmentally relevant concentrations of antibiotics could rapidly induce heritable antibiotic resistance; therefore, the discharge of antibiotics into the environment should be rigorously controlled to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance.",0
"Obesity is a complex metabolic condition that can have a negative impact on one's health and even result in mortality. The management of obesity has been addressed in a number of ways, including lifestyle changes, medication using appetite suppressants and thermogenics, and bariatric surgery for individuals who are severely obese. Liraglutide and semaglutide are two of the five Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-obesity drugs that are FDA-approved agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. In order to highlight the positive effects of these drugs as anti-obesity treatments, we analyzed the weight loss effects of T2DM agents that have demonstrated weight loss effects in this study by evaluating clinical studies that were published for each agent. Many clinical studies have revealed that some antihyperglycemic medications can help people lose weight, while others either cause weight gain or neutral results. Acarbose has mild weight loss effects and metformin and sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter proteins-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have modest weight loss effects; however, some glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists had the greatest impact on weight loss. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors showed a neutral or mild weight loss effect. To sum up, some of the GLP-1 agonist drugs show promise as weight-loss treatments.",1
"Ischemic colitis is the most common type of intestinal ischemia and is caused by an acute arterial occlusion, thrombosis, or hypoperfusion of the mesenteric vasculature. This case centers around a 39-year-old female with a past medical history significant for a 20-year history of stimulant laxative abuse, chronic constipation, bipolar disorder, and anxiety that presented with ischemic colitis following 21 days of obstipation. At the time of presentation, the patient was taking olanzapine 15 mg daily for the treatment of bipolar disorder and clonidine 0.2 mg three times daily for anxiety. Over the course of her hospitalization, the patient was found to have a high stool burden, including calcified stool, contributing to ischemic colitis. She was successfully treated with a clonidine taper, multiple enemas, and laxatives. Pharmacological agents that induce constipation have been shown to increase the risk of colonic ischemia by increasing intraluminal pressure in the colon. Atypical antipsychotics block peripheral anticholinergic and anti-serotonergic receptors, limit gastrointestinal muscle contractions, and delay intestinal transit.",1
We investigated the safety and efficacy of peroneal electrical transcutaneous neuromodulation using the URIS neuromodulation system in a home-based setting in comparison with standard treatment using solifenacin in treatment-naïve female patients with overactive bladder.,1
"Warfarin is well recognized for its high-affinity and capacity-limited binding to the pharmacological target and undergoes target-mediated drug disposition. Here, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that incorporated saturable target binding and other reported hepatic disposition components of warfarin. The PBPK model parameters were optimized by fitting to the reported blood pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of warfarin with no stereoisomeric separation after oral dosing of racemic warfarin (0.1, 2, 5, or 10 mg) using the Cluster Gauss-Newton method (CGNM). The CGNM-based analysis yielded multiple ""accepted"" sets for six optimized parameters, which were then used to simulate the warfarin blood PK and in vivo target occupancy (TO) profiles. When further analyses examined the impact of dose selection on uncertainty in parameter estimation by the PBPK modeling, the PK data from 0.1 mg dose (well below target saturation) was important in practically identifying the target binding-related parameters in vivo. When stereoselective differences were incorporated for both hepatic disposition and target interactions, our PBPK modeling predicted that R-warfarin (of slower clearance and lower target affinity than S-warfarin) contributes to TO prolongation after oral dosing of racemic warfarin. Our results extend the validity of the approach by which the PBPK-TO modeling of blood PK profiles can yield TO prediction in vivo (applicable to the drugs with targets of high affinity and abundance and limited distribution volume via nontarget interactions). Our findings support that model-informed dose selection and PBPK-TO modeling may aid in TO and efficacy assessment in preclinical and clinical phase 1 studies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The current physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling incorporated the reported hepatic disposition components and target binding of warfarin and analyzed the blood pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles from varying warfarin doses, practically identifying target binding-related parameters in vivo. By implementing the stereoselective differences between R- and S-warfarin, our analysis predicted the role of R-warfarin in prolonging overall target occupancy. Our results extend the validity of analyzing blood PK profiles to predict target occupancy in vivo, which may guide efficacy assessment.",0
"The use of hydrochlorothiazide has recently been linked to skin cancer in observational studies. This may be explained by its photosensitizing properties, but photosensitivity has also been reported for other antihypertensive drugs. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare skin cancer risk among antihypertensive drug classes and individual blood pressure lowering drugs.",1
"Atogepant, an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, and topiramate, a commonly used oral antiepileptic, are approved as preventive migraine treatments. Given the distinct mechanisms of action of these treatments, it is possible that they may be coprescribed for migraine. This open-label, single-center, 2-cohort, phase 1 trial evaluated the potential pharmacokinetic (PK) 2-way drug-drug interactions (DDIs), safety, and tolerability of atogepant and topiramate in healthy adults. Participants received atogepant 60 mg once daily and topiramate 100 mg twice daily. Cohort 1 (N = 28) evaluated the effect of topiramate on the PK of atogepant; cohort 2 (N = 25) evaluated the effect of atogepant on the PK of topiramate. Potential DDIs were assessed using geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals calculated for maximum plasma drug concentration at steady state (C<sub>max,ss</sub> ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve during the dosing interval at steady state (AUC<sub>0-tau,ss</sub> ). Additional PK parameters were assessed. Atogepant AUC<sub>0-tau,ss</sub> and C<sub>max,ss</sub> decreased by 25% and 24%, respectively, with topiramate coadministration. Topiramate AUC<sub>0-tau,ss</sub> and C<sub>max,ss</sub> decreased by 5% and 6%, respectively, with atogepant coadministration. The 25% reduction in atogepant exposure when coadministered with topiramate is not considered to be clinically relevant and would not require dose adjustments.",1
"Pterospermum rubiginosum is an evergreen plant in Western Ghats, India, used by traditional tribal healers due to its excellent biological potential for treating inflammation and pain relief procedures. The bark extract is also consumed to relieve the inflammatory changes at the bone fractured site.

"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a key protein in inflammation and contributes to tumor progression. However, the role of IL-1β in cancer is ambiguous or even contradictory. Here, we found that upon IL-1β stimulation, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) in cancer cells is acetylated at lysine (K) 1042 (NNT K1042ac) and thereby induces the mitochondrial translocation of p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). This acetylation enhances NNT activity by increasing the binding affinity of NNT for NADP<sup>+</sup> and therefore boosts NADPH production, which subsequently sustains sufficient iron-sulfur cluster maintenance and protects tumor cells from ferroptosis. Abrogating NNT K1042ac dramatically attenuates IL-1β-promoted tumor immune evasion and synergizes with PD-1 blockade. In addition, NNT K1042ac is associated with IL-1β expression and the prognosis of human gastric cancer. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism of IL-1β-promoted tumor immune evasion, implicating the therapeutic potential of disrupting the link between IL-1β and tumor cells by inhibiting NNT acetylation.",0
"Lichen planus is an inflammatory dermatosis with mucosal variants, including oral lichen planus (OLP). OLP has relapsing chronic courses and may significantly impact quality of life. Following IRB approval, we analyzed the efficacy of metronidazole as a treatment for OLP by retrospective chart review of patients seen at our institution over 10 years with an OLP diagnosis. Thirty patients with OLP were treated with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily. Most patients (n=18, 60.0%) showed improvement with metronidazole, including 10 (33.3%) with complete resolution of symptoms. Our results are limited by the nature of a retrospective review study with a relatively small cohort treated with metronidazole. Given the efficacy, mild side effect profile and the less immunosuppressive nature of metronidazole compared to alternative systemic treatment options, metronidazole is a reasonable option to try in patients with symptomatic OLP who have failed topical treatment options.",1
"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is rare and severe thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and renal dysfunction. In contrast, essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative disease associated with an abnormal increase in platelet numbers. Previous studies reported several cases of the development of ET in patients with TTP. However, the case of an ET patient complicated with TTP has not been previously reported. In this case study, we present a patient with TTP who was previously diagnosed with ET. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of TTP in ET.",0
"Adenomyosis is a uterine condition in which endometrial glands and stroma are commonly pathologically observed in the myometrium. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of resveratrol on the progression of adenomyosis. Adenomyosis was induced in mice given tamoxifen neonatally. All mice were subjected to body weight measurement and hotplate testing every four weeks beginning four weeks after birth. All mice with adenomyosis were randomly separated into 3 groups at 16 weeks: untreated, low-dose resveratrol (25 mg/kg), and high-dose resveratrol (50 mg/kg). After 3 weeks of treatment, final hotplate test and body weight measurement were performed, and the uterine horn blood samples were collected. Adenomyosis in mice caused body weight loss and uterine weight gain, reduced hotplate latency, and progression of endometrial fibrosis. The underlying biological process could be coupled with the overexpression of many cells' proliferation and immune-regulation-related genes. Resveratrol treatment could slow the progression of adenomyosis by enhancing hotplate latency, lowering endometrial fibrosis, and restoring cell proliferation- and immune-regulation-associated gene expression levels in endometrium and plasma. However, resveratrol treatment also reduced the body weight and uterine weight. In conclusion, Resveratrol might be a potential compound for treating patients with adenomyosis.",0
"The sole t(8;22)(p11.2;q11.2)/BCR- FGFR1 chromosomal abnormality formerly known as aCML is an extremely rare disease entity with a history of rapid progression. Though patients resemble phenotypically chronic myeloid leukemia, the treatment of patients with sole BCR-FGFR1 rearrangement are still challenging for clinicians due to rapid progressive nature and unavailability of uniform treatment guidelines. In present case study, we describe a case of myeloid neoplasm with sole chromosomal abnormality of t(8;22)(p11.2;q11.2)/BCR-FGFR1 rearrangement which is successfully managed by Sorafenib with Azacitidine. Hence our case report suggests that combination of Sorafenib and Azacitidine treatment is effective in sole BCR-FGFR1 rearrangement, however this combination therapy should be studied in large clinical trials.",0
"Evidence-based recommendations for treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) should rely on the available literature.

"In this study, the effects of Sildenafil Citrate on the sperm quality during cryopreservation in the asthenozoospermic patients were investigated for the first time. Thirty semen samples were collected from asthenozoospermic patients and each sample was divided into 3 groups: Control (fresh), Freeze and Freeze + Sildenafil. In each groups the sperm parameters, DNA fragmentation, acrosome integrity, protamine deficiency, mitochondrial membrane potential, plasma membrane integrity, the expression of Bcl-2 and HSP70 genes, as well as the level of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Malondialdehyde and antioxidants (Catalase, Glutathione, and Superoxide dismutase) in sperm were assessed. Data were analyzed statistically using Repeated Measure Analysis. The level of Malondialdehyde and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, morphological abnormalities, DNA fragmentation, protamine deficiency and the expression of Bcl-2 and HSP70 genes increased significantly in the Freeze group compared to the Control, while the level of sperm parameters and antioxidants, plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential and acrosomal integrity significantly decreased. In the Freeze + Sildenafil group, compared to the Freeze group, all the mentioned parameters were significantly reversed except for the acrosomal integrity (decreased even more) and the expression of Bcl-2 (increased even more) and HSP70 genes (with no change). Although adding Sildenafil to the freezing medium decreased the adverse effects of freezing on the sperm of asthenozoospermic patients and improved sperm quality, but it also caused premature acrosome reaction. Therefore, we suggest the consumption of Sildenafil along with another antioxidant, to benefit from the favorable effects of Sildenafil as well as to maintain the integrity of the sperm acrosome.",0
"Paracetamol is one of the most widely used drugs worldwide, yet its environmental presence and hazardous impact on non-target organisms could rapidly increase. In this study, the possible cytotoxic effects of paracetamol were evaluated using two bioindicator plants Lens culinaris and Pisum sativum. Concentrations of 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 25, 5, 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, and a control (distilled water) were used for a total of 10 treatments, which were subsequently applied on seeds of Lens culinaris Med. and Pisum sativum L.; after 72 h of exposure, root growth, mitotic index, percentage of chromosomal abnormalities, and the presence of micronucleus were evaluated. The cytotoxic effect of paracetamol on L. culinaris and P. sativum was demonstrated, reporting the inhibition of root growth, the presence of abnormalities, and a significant micronucleus index at all concentrations used, which shows that this drug has a high degree of toxicity.",0

"The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 caused major disruptions of societal functions, including health care. Patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) depend on receiving daily treatment and face a risk of withdrawal in case of medication supply disruption. MOUD are banned in Russia, making treatment continuation impossible in temporarily occupied areas. In this paper, we review the situation with MOUD delivery in Ukraine during the first year of the Russia-Ukraine war. Legislative changes and mobilization of efforts in the time of crisis ensured treatment continuation for thousands of patients. In areas controlled by Ukraine, most patients were receiving take-home doses for up to 30 days, some experienced temporary dosing reductions. Programs in temporarily occupied regions were shut down likely leading to abrupt withdrawal among many patients. At least 10% of patients have been internally displaced. One year into the war, the number of MOUD patients in governmental clinics of Ukraine increased by 17%, and the data suggest that the coverage of private clinics has also increased. But the risks for program stability remain high as the current medication supply relies on one manufacturing facility. Using lessons learned from the crisis, we provide recommendations for future response to minimize the risks of major adverse outcomes among patients treated for opioid use disorder.",0
"Valproic acid (VPA), an anti-epileptic drug (AED), has been reported to exhibit anti-angiogenic properties. This study aimed to examine the impact of VPA on the expression of NRP-1 and additional angiogenic factors, as well as angiogenesis, in mouse placenta. Pregnant mice were divided into four groups: control (K), solvent control (KP), VPA treatment at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight (BW) (P1), and VPA treatment at a dose of 600 mg/kg BW (P2). The mice were subjected to daily treatment via gavage from embryonic day (E) 9 to E14 and E9 to E16. Histological analysis was performed to evaluate Microvascular Density (MVD) and percentage of the placental labyrinth area. In addition, a comparative analysis of Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR-2), and soluble (sFlt1) expression was conducted in relation to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The results of the MVD analysis and percentage of labyrinth area in the E14 and E16 placentas indicated that the treated groups were significantly lower than the control group. The relative expression levels of NRP-1, VEGFA, and VEGFR-2 in the treated groups were lower than those in the control group at E14 and E16. Meanwhile, the relative expression of sFlt1 in the treated groups at E16 was significantly higher than in the control group. Changes in the relative expression of these genes inhibit angiogenesis regulation in the mouse placenta, as evidenced by reduced MVD and a smaller percentage of the labyrinth area.",1
Various approaches using epidural analgesia have been employed for relieving labor pain and promoting spontaneous delivery. We aimed to evaluate the effect of nalbuphine and ropivacaine versus fentanyl and ropivacaine on the duration of delivery in parturients.,1
"Studies have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are superior in primary and secondary prevention for cardiac mortality and morbidity to angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs). One of the common side effects from ACEI is dry cough. The aims of this systematic review, and network meta-analysis are to rank the risk of cough induced by different ACEIs and between ACEI and placebo, ARB or calcium channel blockers (CCB). We performed a systematic review, and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to rank the risk of cough induced by each ACEI and between ACEI and placebo, ARB or CCB. A total of 135 RCTs with 45,420 patients treated with eleven ACEIs were included in the analyses. The pooled estimated relative risk (RR) between ACEI and placebo was 2.21 (95% CI: 2.05-2.39). ACEI had more incidences of cough than ARB (RR 3.2; 95% CI: 2.91, 3.51), and pooled estimated of RR between ACEI and CCB was 5.30 (95% CI: 4.32-6.50) Moexipril ranked as number one for inducing cough (SUCRA 80.4%) and spirapril ranked the least (SUCRA 12.3%). The order for the rest of the ACEIs are as follows: ramipril (SUCRA 76.4%), fosinopril (SUCRA 72.5%), lisinopril (SUCRA 64.7%), benazepril (SUCRA 58.6%), quinapril (SUCRA 56.5%), perindopril (SUCRA 54.1%), enalapril (SUCRA 49.7%), trandolapril (SUCRA 44.6%) and, captopril (SUCRA 13.7%). All ACEI has the similar risk of developing a cough. ACEI should be avoided in patients who have risk of developing cough, and an ARB or CCB is an alternative based on the patient's comorbidity.",1
"Ischemic colitis accounts for many cases of bowel infarction. Usually, it has various manifestations, such as vomiting, abdominal pain, hematochezia and many other symptoms. Risk factors might include age, medications, hypercoagulable state and chronic illnesses. However, it can still occur in healthy young patients. This might make it difficult for physicians to establish a correct diagnosis and generate the appropriate treatment plan for patients suffering from ischemic colitis. In this case we report a previously healthy 37-year-old female who had a sudden onset of lower abdominal pain associated with hematochezia. This patient was treated for upper respiratory tract infection by amoxicillin-clavulanate 2 weeks prior to her symptoms. The computed tomography abdomen findings along with the exploratory laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis of ischemic colitis. Ischemic colitis is a serious condition with high mortality and morbidity rate. Therefore, prompt investigation, and if indicated, surgical intervention should be calculated in sick patients complaining of abdominal pain and lower gastrointestinal bleeding.",1
"Baclofen may reduce the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, as an alternative or as an adjuvant for benzodiazepines, but the available data are insufficient to support baclofen-assisted alcohol withdrawal. This study investigated the need for diazepam during acute alcohol withdrawal in patients receiving baclofen. In a single-blind, dose-dependent randomized controlled trial with three study arms, 63 patients with alcohol use disorder, starting in-patient benzodiazepine-assisted alcohol detoxification, were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 18), baclofen 30 mg/day (N = 20), or baclofen 60 mg/day (N = 25) for 7 days. Diazepam was provided as needed based on the withdrawal symptoms stated by Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-revised. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients in need of diazepam during alcohol detoxification. Secondary outcome measure included the between-group difference in the amount of diazepam needed during alcohol detoxification. Using baclofen 60 mg/day, 32% of patients needed additional diazepam compared to 35% on baclofen 30 mg/day and compared to 72% on placebo (P = .013). The median total amount of diazepam needed was significantly lower in patients receiving baclofen 60 mg/day (0 ± 10 mg diazepam) and baclofen 30 mg/day (0 ± 10 mg diazepam) compared to placebo (10 ± 43 mg diazepam; P = .017). Adverse events were comparable between patients on baclofen and placebo. Baclofen can reduce the withdrawal symptoms during alcohol detoxification. Baclofen was well tolerated and may be considered for the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, especially useful in situations where benzodiazepines should be withheld, such as patients with liver impairment.",1
"Antiseizure medication (ASM) as monotherapy or in combination is the treatment of choice for most patients with epilepsy. Therefore, knowledge about the typical adverse events (AEs) for ASMs and other coadministered drugs (CDs) is essential for practitioners and patients. Due to frequent polypharmacy, it is often difficult to clinically assess the AE profiles of ASMs and differentiate the influence of CDs.",1
The combination of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) plus warfarin in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients after coronary stenting has been reported to confer a significant risk of bleeding complications. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) reduce the risk of stroke and bleeding complications in AF patients compared to warfarin. The optimal anticoagulation strategy for Japanese non-valvular AF patients after coronary stenting remains unclear.,1
"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A1 (eIF5A1) and 5A2 (eIF5A2) are important proteins in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes and their function has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer, and viral infections. Here, we report two new genome-edited mouse models, generated using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach, in which the amino acid residue lysine 50 is replaced with arginine 50 (K50R) in eIF5A1 or in the closely related eIF5A2 protein. This mutation prevents the spermidine-dependent post-translational formation of hypusine, a unique lysine derivative that is necessary for activation of eIF5A1 and eIF5A2. Mouse brain lysates from homozygous eif5a2-K50R mutant mice (eif5a2K50R/K50R) confirmed the absence of hypusine formation of eIF5A2, and metabolomic analysis of primary mouse dermal fibroblasts revealed significant alterations in the metabolite landscape compared to controls including increased levels of tryptophan, kyrunenine, pyridoxine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, riboflavin, flavin adenine dinucleotide, pantothenate, and coenzyme A. Further supported by new publicly available bioinformatics data, these new mouse models represent excellent in vivo models to study hypusine-dependent biological processes, hypusination-related disorders caused by eIF5A1 and eIF5A2 gene aberrations or mRNA expression dysregulation, as well as several major human cancer types and potential therapies.",0
"The treatment of insomnia, which is the most common sleep disorder, includes drug and behavioral treatment, but each treatment measure has its limitations.

"A drug-drug interaction (DDI) exists between bictegravir and metformin. Bictegravir inhibits renal organic cation transporter-2, leading to increased metformin plasma concentrations. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the clinical implications of concomitant bictegravir and metformin administration. This was a retrospective, single-center, descriptive analysis evaluating people with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) concurrently prescribed bictegravir and metformin between February 2018-June 2020. PWH lost to follow-up or non-adherent were excluded. Data collection included: hemoglobin A1C (HgbA1C), HIV RNA viral load, CD4 cell count, serum creatinine, and lactate. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were assessed by provider-documented, patient-reported symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance and hypoglycemia. Metformin dose adjustments and discontinuations were recorded. Fifty-three PWH were included (116 screened; 63 excluded). GI intolerance was reported in three PWH (5.7%). There were no documented episodes of hypoglycemia or lactic acidosis. Five PWH had metformin dose reductions (N = 3 for unspecified reasons; N = 1 for GI intolerance) or discontinuation (N = 1 unrelated to ADRs). Both diabetes and HIV control improved (HgbA1C decreased by 0.7% with virologic control in 95% of PWH). Minimal ADRs were reported in PWH receiving concurrent metformin and bictegravir. Prescribers should be aware of this potential interaction; however, no empiric metformin total daily dose adjustment appears necessary.",1

"It is of great significance to realize ultra-sensitive and visual detection of oxytetracycline (OTC) residues, especially for public health and environmental safety. In this study, a multicolor fluorescence sensing platform (CDs-Cit-Eu) for OTC detection was constructed by using rare earth europium complex functionalized carbon dots (CDs). The blue-emitting CDs (λ<sub>em</sub> = 450 nm) prepared by one-step hydrothermal method using nannochloropsis were not only the scaffold of Eu<sup>3+</sup> ion coordination, but also the recognition unit of OTC. After adding OTC to the multicolor fluorescent sensor, the emission intensity of CDs decreased slowly, and the emission intensity of Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions (λ<sub>em</sub> = 617 nm) enhanced significantly, accompanying by a significant color change of the nanoprobe from blue to red. The detection limit of the probe for OTC was calculated to be 3.5 nM, manifesting ultra-high sensitivity towards OTC detection. In addition, OTC detection in real samples (honey, lake water, tap water) was successfully achieved. Moreover, a semi-hydrophobic luminescent film SA/PVA/CDs-Cit-Eu was also prepared for OTC detection. With the help of smartphone color recognition APP, real-time intelligent detection of OTC was realized.",0
"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a tumor that infiltrates several brain structures. GBM is associated with abnormal motor activities resulting in impaired mobility, producing a loss of functional motor independence. We used a GBM xenograft implanted in the striatum to analyze the changes in Y (vertical) and X (horizontal) axis displacement of the metatarsus, ankle, and knee. We analyzed the steps dissimilarity factor between control and GBM mice with and without anastrozole. The body weight of the untreated animals decreased compared to treated mice. Anastrozole reduced the malignant cells and decreased GPR30 and ERα receptor expression. In addition, we observed a partial recovery in metatarsus and knee joint displacement (dissimilarity factor). The vertical axis displacement of the GBM+anastrozole group showed a difference in the right metatarsus, right knee, and left ankle compared to the GBM group. In the horizontal axis displacement of the right metatarsus, ankle, and knee, the GBM+anastrozole group exhibited a difference at the last third of the step cycle compared to the GBM group. Thus, anastrozole partially modified joint displacement. The dissimilarity factor and the vertical and horizontal displacements study will be of interest in GBM patients with locomotion alterations. Hindlimb displacement and gait locomotion analysis could be a valuable methodological tool in experimental and clinical studies to help diagnose locomotive deficits related to GBM.",0
"Herein, we describe a case of olmesartan-related sprue-like enteropathy in which improvement in villous atrophy was confirmed by small-bowel capsule endoscopy (CE). We successfully treated a 66-year-old man with a chief complaint of loose diarrhea. The patient had persistent watery diarrhea 10 times a day and experienced a weight loss of 9 kg in 3 months. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed fluid retention in the small intestine. Blood test results revealed no inflammatory reaction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy detected villous atrophy in the stomach and duodenum. Moreover, small-bowel CE showed villous atrophy in about two-thirds of the small intestine. Based on other examinations, hyperthyroidism, intestinal tuberculosis, intestinal amyloidosis, and intestinal malignant lymphoma were ruled out. Therefore, the patient was suspected of having an olmesartan-related sprue-like disease. Early after discontinuation of medication, diarrhea symptoms improved, and a repeat CE indicated improvements in small intestinal villous atrophy. Since the patient had been administered olmesartan for a long time and CE showed villous atrophy throughout the small bowel, we suspected him of having the olmesartan-associated sprue-like disease. The findings of gastric mucosa atrophy on esophagogastroduodenoscopy may lead to an early diagnosis of this disease. Olmesartan-related sprue-like enteropathy should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with chronic severe watery diarrhea.",1
The high seizure burden seen in World Health Association (WHO) grade 2 gliomas is well documented. This study aims to identify factors that influence the probability of seizure freedom (12 months of seizure remission) and treatment failure (antiseizure medication [ASM] cessation or introduction of an alternative) in patients with WHO grade 2 glioma.,1
"Dopamine (DA) loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) causes debilitating motor deficits. However, dopamine is also widely linked to reward prediction and learning, and the contribution of dopamine-dependent learning to movements that are impaired in PD-which often do not lead to explicit rewards-is unclear. Here, we used two distinct motor tasks to dissociate dopamine's acute motoric effects vs. its long-lasting, learning-mediated effects. In dopamine-depleted mice, motor task performance gradually worsened with task exposure. Task experience was critical, as mice that remained in the home cage during the same period were relatively unimpaired when subsequently probed on the task. Repeated dopamine replacement treatments acutely rescued deficits and gradually induced long-term rescue that persisted despite treatment withdrawal. Surprisingly, both long-term rescue and parkinsonian performance decline were task specific, implicating dopamine-dependent learning. D1R activation potently induced acute rescue that gradually consolidated into long-term rescue. Conversely, reduced D2R activation potently induced parkinsonian decline. In dopamine-depleted mice, either D1R activation or D2R activation prevented parkinsonian decline, and both restored balanced activation of direct vs. indirect striatal pathways. These findings suggest that reinforcement and maintenance of movements-even movements not leading to explicit rewards-are fundamental functions of dopamine and provide potential mechanisms for the hitherto unexplained ""long-duration response"" by dopaminergic therapies in PD.",0
"Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening infection commonly seen in patients with advanced HIV infection and solid organ transplant recipients. We report a case of cryptococcal meningitis with immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) who presented to us with a headache and complete loss of vision in the left eye. He was managed with antifungals and a short course of steroids, and he regained vision completely. In the hospital, he developed complications including tacrolimus toxicity, fluconazole-induced QT prolongation, and flucytosine-induced thrombocytopenia. Our case demonstrates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the management of complex cases like cryptococcal meningitis in solid organ transplant recipients.",1

"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a neurological disorder characterized by persistent limb symptoms. With there being no definitive tests, diagnosis can be challenging. The Budapest criteria are the standard for diagnosis. The underlying mechanisms of CRPS involve changes in skin innervation, sensitization of the nervous system, inflammatory cytokines, and genetic and psychological factors. Treatment typically involves a multidisciplinary approach. We present a case of a 71-year-old male with CRPS involving the right upper extremity and a complex history of management including physical therapy, oxycodone, muscle relaxers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and multiple stellate ganglion blocks. The patient manages his pain with off-label medications, including methadone, duloxetine, and pregabalin. In the United States, the management of chronic pain may be affected by potential usage restrictions imposed by the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA). Under this new act, physicians may face limitations in prescribing off-label medications for specific diagnoses. We aim to highlight the need for prioritizing patient care and individualized treatment in healthcare policy decision-making.",1
Characterisation of genetic variation that influences the response to glucose-lowering medications is instrumental to precision medicine for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The Study to Understand the Genetics of the Acute Response to Metformin and Glipizide in Humans (SUGAR-MGH) examined the acute response to metformin and glipizide in order to identify new pharmacogenetic associations for the response to common glucose-lowering medications in individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes.,0

"Excessive use and release of antibiotics into the soil environment in the developing world have resulted in altered soil processes affecting terrestrial organisms and posing a serious threat to crop growth and productivity. The present study investigated the influence of exogenously applied oxytetracycline (OXY) and levofloxacin (LEV) on plant physiological responses, key enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism (e.g., nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase), nitrogen contents and oxidative stress response of mung bean (Vigna radiata). Plants were irrigated weekly with antibiotics containing water for exposing the plants to different concentrations i.e., 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. Results showed a significant decrease in nitrate reductase activity in both antibiotic treatments and their mixtures and increased antioxidant enzymatic activities in plants. At lower concentrations of antibiotics (≤20 mg L<sup>-1</sup>), 53.9 % to 78.4 % increase in nitrogen content was observed in levofloxacin and mixtures compared to the control, resulting in an increase in the overall plant biomass. Higher antibiotic (≥50 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) concentration showed 58 % decrease in plant biomass content and an overall decrease in plant nitrogen content upon exposure to the mixtures. This was further complemented by 22 % to 42 % increase in glutamine synthetase activity observed in the plants treated with levofloxacin and mixtures. The application of low doses of antibiotics throughout the experiments resulted in lower toxicity symptoms in the plants. However, significantly higher malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations at higher doses (20 mg L<sup>-1</sup> and above) than the control showed that plants' tolerance against oxidative stress was conceded with increasing antibiotic concentrations.

"Introduction Klebsiella pneumonia is one of the most prevalent bacteria that cause nosocomial infections, particularly in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (MDRKP) has become an urgent risk to public health as its prevalence has sharply surged around the globe in recent decades. Therefore, this research was conducted to evaluate shifts over a four-year period in drug susceptibility patterns among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients. Materials and methods This is a retrospective observational study conducted in a tertiary care multi-specialty hospital and teaching institute in North India and was approved by the institutional ethics committee. The research comprised Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from endotracheal aspirates (ETA) of patients on mechanical ventilation admitted to the general intensive care unit (ICU) of our tertiary care facility. The data from January to June 2018 and January to June 2022 were collected. According to the antimicrobial resistance profile of the strains, they were categorized as susceptible, resistant to one or two antimicrobial categories, multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), or pan-drug-resistant (PDR). The criteria for MDR, XDR, and PDR were proposed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, Version 24.0, Armonk, NY, IBM Corp., was used for data input and analysis. Results A total of 82 cases of Klebsiella pneumonia were included in the study. Of these 82 isolates, 40 were isolated over a period of six months from January to June 2018, and the remaining 42 were isolated from January to June 2022. Among the 2018 group, five strains (12.5%) were classified as susceptible, three (7.5%) as resistant, seven (17.5%) as MDR, and 25 (62.5%) as XDR. The highest percentages of antimicrobial resistance in the 2018 group were observed with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (90%), ciprofloxacin (100%), piperacillin/tazobactam (92.5%), and cefoperazone/sulbactam (95%). In comparison, the 2022 group showed no strain as susceptible; nine strains (21.4%) were classified as resistant; three strains (7%) as MDR; and 30 strains (93%) were classified as XDR. There was a significant increase in resistance to amoxicillin, from 10% in 2018 to nil in 2022. Overall, the rate of resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia) increased from 7.5% (3/40) in 2018 to 21.4% (9/42) in 2022, while XDR Klebsiella pneumonia among the mechanically ventilated ICU patients significantly increased from 62.5% (25/40) in 2018 to 71% (30/42) in 2022. Conclusion  K. pneumoniae antibiotic resistance is a real threat in Asia and requires close monitoring to be controlled. More careful attempts should be made to create a new generation of antimicrobials since the prevalence of resistance to existing medications is rising. Antibiotic resistance should be monitored and reported by healthcare institutions regularly.",0
A light-assisted RAFT copolymerization protocol is established and investigated for the synthesis of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) / spiropyran acrylate (SPA) copolymers with enhanced SPA-contents. Radiation with visible light prevents the spiropyran (SP) motif from isomerizing into the open merocyanine (MC) form which can interfere with the polymerization process by abstracting a hydrogen atom from an active radical via its phenolic oxygen.,0
"We report a case of a woman who experienced unexplained recurrent rashes of varying severity after multiple exposures to anesthesia, and then 2 successful surgeries under general anesthesia with no resultant rashes after removing propofol from her anesthetic plans.

"The liver plays a very important role in physiological processes of the human body. Liver regeneration has developed into an important area of study in liver disease. The Mtz (metronidazole)/NTR (nitroreductase)-mediated cell ablation system has been widely used to study the processes and mechanisms of liver injury and regeneration. However, high concentrations and toxic side effects of Mtz severely limit the application of the Mtz/NTR system. Therefore, screening new analogs to replace Mtz has become an important means to optimize the NTR ablation system. In this study, we screened five Mtz analogs including furazolidone, ronidazole, ornidazole, nitromide, and tinidazole. We compared their toxicity on the transgenic fish line <i>Tg(fabp10a: mCherry-NTR)</i> and their specific ablation ability on liver cells. The results showed that Ronidazole at a lower concentration (2 mM) had the same ability to ablate liver cells comparable with that of Mtz (10 mM), almost without toxic side effects on juvenile fish. Further study found that zebrafish hepatocyte injury caused by the Ronidazole/NTR system achieved the same liver regenerative effect as the Mtz/NTR system. The above results show that Ronidazole can replace Mtz with NTR to achieve superior damage and ablation effects in zebrafish liver.",0

"The existence of sex differences in schizophrenia is a well documented phenomenon which led to the hypothesis that female sex hormones are neuroprotective and hence responsible for the more favorable disease characteristics seen in women. The current study sought to investigate the effects of estrogen-like agents administered during early adolescence on behavioral outcomes in adulthood using the neurodevelopmental maternal immune activation (MIA) rodent model of schizophrenia. Female MIA offspring were administered during the asymptomatic period of adolescence with either 17β-estradiol, raloxifene or saline and were tested in late adolescence and adulthood for schizophrenia-related behavioral performance. We report here that whereas adult female MIA offspring exhibited cognitive deficits in the form of retarded spatial learning, the administration of raloxifene during adolescence was sufficient in preventing these deficits and resulted in intact performance in the MIA group.",0

"The eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) decreased gradually. This study aimed to analyze the efficacy and safety of a 14-day combination of vonoprazan and amoxicillin as the first-line eradication therapy for H. pylori infection and compared them with those of the bismuth quadruple therapy. A prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed, involving patients with H. pylori infection in 6 institutions who did not receive any treatment yet. They were randomly assigned into the VA-dual group (vonoprazan 20 mg b.i.d + amoxicillin 750 mg q.i.d) or EACP-quadruple group (esomeprazole 20 mg + amoxicillin 1000 mg + clarithromycin 500 mg + colloidal bismuth subcitrate 220 mg b.i.d) for 14 days in a ratio of 1:1. At least 28 days later, the eradication rate was detected by the <sup>13</sup>C-urea breath test (UBT). A total of 562 patients from February 2022 to September 2022 were enrolled and 316 were random. In the ITT analysis, the eradication rates of H. pylori in the VA-dual group and EACP-quadruple group were 89.9% and 81.0%, respectively, p = 0.037. In the PP analysis were 97.9% and 90.8%, p = 0.009. The different eradication rate was 8.9% (95% CI 1.2-16.5%) and 7.2% (95% CI 1.8-12.4%) in ITT and PP analyses, both lower limit of the 95%CI was still higher than the prespecified margin. In addition, the incidence of adverse events in the VA-dual group was significantly lower than that in the EACP-quadruple group (19.0% vs. 43.0%, P < 0.001). The efficacy and safety of a 14-day combination therapy of vonoprazan and amoxicillin in eradicating H. pylori are superior to bismuth quadruple therapy, and this combination significantly reduces the use of antibiotics.",1

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with impaired social behavior and communication, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. In addition to genetic factors, environmental factors such as prenatal drug exposure contribute to the development of ASD. However, how those prenatal factors induce behavioral deficits in the adult stage is not clear. To elucidate ASD pathogenesis at the molecular level, we performed a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice exposed to valproic acid (VPA) in utero, a widely used animal model of ASD. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in VPA-exposed mice showed significant overlap with ASD risk genes, including differentially expressed genes from the postmortem cortex of ASD patients. Functional annotations of the DEPs revealed significant enrichment in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is dysregulated by the upregulation of Rnf146 in VPA-exposed mice. Consistently, overexpressing Rnf146 in the PFC impaired social behaviors and altered the Wnt signaling pathway in adult mice. Furthermore, Rnf146-overexpressing PFC neurons showed increased excitatory synaptic transmission, which may underlie impaired social behavior. These results demonstrate that Rnf146 is critical for social behavior and that dysregulation of Rnf146 underlies social deficits in VPA-exposed mice.",1
"This work successfully synthesized the salicylic acid@polyurea-formaldehyde (SA@PUF) microcapsules with PUF microcapsules as shell material and SA as core material. The loading content of SA in the PUF microcapsules was approximately 40 %. The SA@PUF microcapsules had excellent long-term antibacterial properties because the PUF microcapsules controlled the release of SA antifouling agents with the ability to induce reactive oxygen species generation and inactivate bacteria. The antibacterial efficiency of SA@PUF microcapsules after 35 days against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained at 80 % and 81 %, increased by 60 % and 62 % compared with pure SA, respectively. The impedance modulus at 0.01 Hz of the SA@PUF coating reached 5.51 GΩ cm<sup>2</sup>, much higher than blank coating (2.55 GΩ cm<sup>2</sup>) and PUF coating (4.94 GΩ cm<sup>2</sup>), indicating that the anti-corrosion property of the SA@PUF coating was much better. This work would contribute to developing novel coatings with long-term antibacterial activity and excellent anti-corrosion performance.",0

"Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is the most common calcium phosphate ceramic that is used in biomedical applications, e.g., as an inorganic component of bone scaffolds. Nevertheless, fluorapatite (FAP) has gained great attention in the area of bone tissue engineering in recent times. The aim of this study was a comprehensive comparative evaluation of the biomedical potential of fabricated HAP- and FAP-based bone scaffolds, to assess which bioceramic is better for regenerative medicine applications. It was demonstrated that both biomaterials had a macroporous microstructure, with interconnected porosity, and were prone to slow and gradual degradation in a physiological environment and in acidified conditions mimicking the osteoclast-mediated bone resorption process. Surprisingly, FAP-based biomaterial revealed a significantly higher degree of biodegradation than biomaterial containing HAP, which indicated its higher bioabsorbability. Importantly, the biomaterials showed a similar level of biocompatibility and osteoconductivity regardless of the bioceramic type. Both scaffolds had the ability to induce apatite formation on their surfaces, proving their bioactive property, that is crucial for good implant osseointegration. In turn, performed biological experiments showed that tested bone scaffolds were non-toxic and their surfaces promoted cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, the biomaterials did not exert a stimulatory effect on immune cells, since they did not generate excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), indicating a low risk of inflammatory response after implantation. In conclusion, based on the obtained results, both FAP- and HAP-based scaffolds have an appropriate microstructure and high biocompatibility, being promising biomaterials for bone regeneration applications. However, FAP-based biomaterial has higher bioabsorbability than the HAP-based scaffold, which is a very important property from the clinical point of view, because it enables a progressive replacement of the bone scaffold with newly formed bone tissue.",0
"Effect of exogenous riboflavin on sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) corrosion of a spirally welded joint (WJ) of X80 steel was investigated by SEM/EDS, XPS, 3D ultra-depth microscopy and electrochemical measurements. The main style of SRB corrosion of the WJ is local corrosion. The local corrosion sensitivity of the heating affected zone (HAZ) of the WJ was always lower than that of the weld zone (WZ) and base metal (BM) in all the SRB-inoculated mediums. SRB corrosion of the WJ is selective. With the dosage increase of riboflavin, the selective pitting corrosion of the WJ becomes more pronounced.",0
"Treatment for lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS) is mainly classified into conservative and surgical therapies. Among conservative therapies, pharmacological treatment is commonly prescribed for LSCS. Meanwhile, surgical treatment is the last option for LSCS. This study aimed to examine the impact of lumbar surgery on pharmacological treatment for patients with LSCS. Consecutive patients aged ≥ 40 years who underwent lumbar surgery for LSCS were identified. A total of 142 patients were retrospectively reviewed for preoperative and 6-month and 1-year postoperative LSCS medications. The results showed that the number of LSCS medications significantly decreased after lumbar surgery. The proportion of the patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pregabalin/mirogabalin, opioids, prostaglandin E1 analogs, and neurotropin was significantly decreased after lumbar surgery, but that of the patients taking mecobalamin, acetaminophen, and serotonin-noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors was not significantly changed. Additionally, around 15% of the participants showed an increase in LSCS medications even after lumbar surgery. Multivariable analysis revealed that individuals without improvements in walking ability (RR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.9) or social life (RR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-5.0) had a greater risk of a postoperative increase in LSCS medications. The study results may provide physicians with beneficial information on treatment for LSCS.",1
"The orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR139 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and has attracted considerable interest as a therapeutic target. However, the biological role of this receptor remains somewhat elusive, in part due to the lack of quality pharmacological tools to investigate GPR139 function. In an effort to understand GPR139 signaling and to identify improved compounds, in this study we performed virtual screening and analog searches, in combination with multiple pharmacological assays. We characterized GPR139-dependent signaling using previously published reference agonists in Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and inositol monophosphate accumulation assays, as well as a novel real-time GPR139 internalization assay. For the four reference agonists tested, the rank order of potency was conserved across signaling and internalization assays: JNJ-63533054 > Compound 1a » Takeda > AC4 > DL43, consistent with previously reported values. We noted an increased efficacy of JNJ-63533054-mediated inositol monophosphate signaling and internalization, relative to Compound 1a. We then performed virtual screening for GPR139 agonist and antagonist compounds that were screened and validated in GPR139 functional assays. We identified four GPR139 agonists that were active in all assays, with similar or reduced potency relative to known compounds. Likewise, compound analogs selected based on GPR139 agonist and antagonist substructure searches behaved similarly to their parent compounds. Thus, we have characterized GPR139 signaling for multiple new ligands using G protein-dependent assays and a new real-time internalization assay. These data add to the GPR139 tool compound repertoire, which could be optimized in future medical chemistry campaigns.",0
"The evaluation of contamination by domestic sewage is relevant in the Amazon region; however, it has neither been well-developed nor accompanied by research or monitoring programs. In this study, caffeine and coprostanol as indicators of sewage were investigated in water samples from Amazonian water bodies that crisscross the city of Manaus (Amazonas state, Brazil) and cover regions with distinct main land uses such as high-density residential, low-density residential, commercial, industrial, and environmental protection areas. Thirty-one water samples were studied based on their dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) fractions. Quantitative determination of both caffeine and coprostanol was carried out using LC-MS/MS with APCI in the positive ionization mode. The streams of the urban area of Manaus had the highest concentrations of caffeine (1.47-69.65 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) and coprostanol (2.88-46.92 μg L<sup>-1</sup>). Samples from the peri-urban Tarumã-Açu stream and from the streams in the Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve showed much lower concentrations of caffeine (20.20-165.78 ng L<sup>-1</sup>) and coprostanol (31.49-120.44 ng L<sup>-1</sup>). Samples from the Negro River showed a wider range of concentrations of caffeine (20.59-873.59 ng L<sup>-1</sup>) and coprostanol (31.72-706.46 ng L<sup>-1</sup>), with the highest values found in the outfalls of the urban streams. Levels of caffeine and coprostanol were significantly positively correlated in the different organic matter fractions. The coprostanol/(coprostanol + cholestanol) ratio proved to be a more suitable parameter than the coprostanol/cholesterol one in low-density residential areas. Proximity to densely populated areas and the flow of water bodies appear to influence the caffeine and coprostanol concentrations, which was observed in their clustering in the multivariate analysis. The results indicate that caffeine and coprostanol can be detected even in water bodies that receive very low domestic sewage input. Therefore, this study revealed that both caffeine in DOM and coprostanol in POM represent viable alternatives for use in studies and monitoring programs even in remote areas of the Amazon, where microbiological analyses are often unfeasible.",0
"Enantioseparation of five β-adrenergic blockers was studied using two mobile phases on a cellulose tris(3-chloro-4-methylphenylcarbamate) (Lux-Cellulose-2) chiral column in normal phase mode. The first mobile phase composed of n-hexane: ethanol: diethylamine 60: 40: 0.1 by volume has successfully resolved the chromatographic peaks of three pairs of β-adrenergic blockers namely, bisoprolol, carvedilol and atenolol. A mixture of n-hexane: ethanol: diethyl amine 75: 25: 0.1 by volume was used as the second mobile phase to separate the four pairs of enantiomers, metoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol and atenolol with high resolution values. The mobile phases were pumped at a flow rate 1 mL/min with column temperature 25 °C using a UV detector at 230 nm. Molecular docking simulations of the five pairs of enantiomers was carried out in the cavities of the chiral stationary phase to gain a better understanding of the interaction between analyte enantiomers and chiral stationary phase and to better understand the mechanism of chiral recognition. According to the results, hydrogen bond interactions and π-π- interactions were the main types of interaction involved in the chiral recognition. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to investigate the solvent effect on the interaction of the five pair of enantiomers in the chiral stationary phase cavity under dynamic conditions.",0
"A suitable additive for fish sperm storage in vitro is necessary for artificial reproduction. In this study, we evaluated the effects of different concentrations (100, 200, 400, and 800 µmol/L) of metformin (Met) on Schizothorax prenanti and Onychostoma macrolepis sperm under storage in vitro for 72 h. Compared with the control group, 400 µmol/L Met was more effective at improving the quality and fertilization capacity of S. prenanti sperm by increasing the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content within the sperm. Further study found that Met stabilized the ATP level by enhancing the glucose uptake in S. prenanti sperm, and this effect might be associated with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in sperm. In this study, we also found that glucose could be absorbed by the sperm of S. prenanti, which was mainly accumulated in the midpiece of S. prenanti sperm, where mitochondria were located. In addition, Compound C significantly inhibited the beneficial effects of Met on the quality and glucose uptake capacity of S. prenanti sperm by inhibiting AMPK phosphorylation. These results revealed that AMPK played an important role in vitro sperm storage, and Met maintained ATP content and increased the storage time of S. prenanti sperm in vitro for 72 h, possibly due to Met enhanced glucose uptake capacity of sperm by activating AMPK. Similarly, the beneficial effects of Met on S. prenanti sperm were also found in O. macrolepis sperm, suggesting that Met may hold great promise for the practice of storing fish in vitro.",0

"A 48-year-old woman with a history of primary hypothyroidism, presented with compressive symptoms secondary to a rapid enlargement of a preexisting goiter. She had no clinical signs of hypocalcemia. Biological tests revealed hypoparathyroidism. Cervicothoracic computed tomography scan showed a heterogeneous compressive goiter. The patient was treated with levothyroxine, calcium, and alfacalcidol. A total thyroidectomy was not performed because of the hard adhesion to neighboring structures. Histopathological examination of the thyroid biopsy was consistent with the diagnosis of Riedel's thyroiditis (RT). The patient was treated with glucocorticoids. The outcome was marked by the resolution of compressive symptoms and the decrease of the thyroid gland volume. Serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels reached normal ranges after the discontinuation of vitaminocalcic supplementation. Hypoparathyroidism may be clinically asymptomatic in a patient with RT as in our case. Early administration of glucocorticoids may be effective in reducing the fibrosclerotic process and lead to the recovery of parathyroid dysfunction.",0
"The benefits of long-term oral β-blocker therapy in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; ≥40%) are still unknown. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of β-blocker therapy in patients with STEMI with mildly reduced LVEF. In the CAPITAL-RCT (Carvedilol Post-Intervention Long-Term Administration in Large-Scale Randomized Controlled Trial), patients with STEMI with successful percutaneous coronary intervention with an LVEF of ≥40% were randomly assigned to carvedilol or no β-blocker therapy. Among 794 patients, 280 patients had an LVEF of <55% at baseline (mildly reduced LVEF stratum), whereas 514 patients had an LVEF of ≥55% at baseline (normal LVEF stratum). The primary end point was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for heart failure, and the secondary end point was a cardiac composite outcome: a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure. The median follow-up period was 3.7 years. The lower risk of carvedilol therapy relative to no β-blocker therapy was not significant for the primary end point in either the mildly reduced or normal LVEF strata. However, it was significant for the cardiac composite end point in the mildly reduced LVEF stratum (0.82/100 person-years vs 2.59/100 person-years, hazard ratio 0.32 [0.10 to 0.99], p = 0.047) but not in the normal LVEF stratum (1.48/100 person-years vs 1.06/100 person-years, hazard ratio 1.39 [0.62 to 3.13], p = 0.43, p for interaction = 0.04). In conclusion, long-term carvedilol therapy in patients with STEMI with primary percutaneous coronary intervention might be beneficial for preventing cardiac-related events in those with a mildly reduced LVEF.",0
"We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model for predicting cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with diabetes (DM). This was a prospective, observational study where clinical data of patients with diabetes hospitalized in the diabetology center in Poland (years 2015-2020) were analyzed using ML. The occurrence of new CV events following discharge was collected in the follow-up time for up to 5 years and 9 months. An end-to-end ML technique which exploits the neighborhood component analysis for elaborating discriminative predictors, followed by a hybrid sampling/boosting classification algorithm, multiple logistic regression (MLR), or unsupervised hierarchical clustering was proposed. In 1735 patients with diabetes (53% female), there were 150 (8.65%) ones with a new CV event in the follow-up. Twelve most discriminative patients' parameters included coronary artery disease, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, stroke, diabetic foot disease, chronic kidney disease, eosinophil count, serum potassium level, and being treated with clopidogrel, heparin, proton pump inhibitor, and loop diuretic. Utilizing those variables resulted in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.62 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.56-0.68, P < 0.01) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.77, P < 0.01) across 5 nonoverlapping test folds, whereas MLR correctly determined 111/150 (74.00%) high-risk patients, and 989/1585 (62.40%) low-risk patients, resulting in 1100/1735 (63.40%) correctly classified patients (AUC: 0.72, 95% CI 0.66-0.77). ML algorithms can identify patients with diabetes at a high risk of new CV events based on a small number of interpretable and easy-to-obtain patients' parameters.",0

"Berries are important components of the human diet, valued for their high content of nutrients and active compounds. Berry seeds are also important objects of scientific investigation as, in some cases, they can have a higher concentration of certain phytochemicals than other parts of the fruit. Moreover, they are often byproducts of the food industry that can be reused to make oil, extracts, or flour. We have reviewed available literature related to the chemical content and biological activity of seeds from five different berry species-red raspberry (<i>Rubus idaeus</i> L. and <i>Rubus coreanus</i> Miq.), strawberry (<i>Fragaria x ananassa</i>), grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), sea buckthorn (<i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> L.), and cranberry (<i>Vaccinium macrocarpon</i> Ait.). We have searched various databases, including PubMed, Web of Knowledge, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. Last search was conducted on 16.01.2023. Various preparations from berry seeds are valuable sources of bioactive phytochemicals and could be used as functional foods or to make pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. Some products, like oil, flour, or extracts, are already available on the market. However, many preparations and compounds still lack appropriate evidence for their effectiveness in vivo, so their activity should first be assessed in animal studies and clinical trials.",0

"This study elucidated the compositional and structural variations of size fractions of microbially-induced dissolved organic matter (DOM) caused by short-term temperature changes (5 to 35 °C), taking riverine DOM as an example. A simple and efficient method combining fractionation-[parallel factor analysis and two-dimensional Fourier-transform infrared correlation spectroscopy (PARAFAC-2D FTIR COS)]-correlation was introduced to link fluorescent DOM components and their structures in terms of surface functional groups. Results indicated that the higher temperature stimulated the decomposition of aromatics (sizes decreased from 10 kDa-0.22 μm to <10 kDa) and the transformation of proteins to humics (with sizes <0.22 μm); while both the higher and lower temperatures inhibited the utilization of larger-sized DOM (>0.22 μm, especially the non-fluorescence part) and synthesis of larger-sized microbial-derived proteins and humics (>0.22 μm), which may result in more smaller-sized (<10 kDa) and refractory aromatics transported from rivers to oceans in the warming future. However, the structure-determined DOM behaviors could be less affected by temperature since the fluorescent proteins and humics revealed similar functional group compositions, such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl/aldehyde, carboxylic anhydride, and carboxamide groups. These findings have strong implications for DOM biogeochemistry in future temperature-shock scenarios. The proposed method will support in-depth analyses of structure-regulated processes from a mechanistic perspective.",0
"Wood is a biosourced material with unique aesthetic features due to its anatomy and chemical composition. White oak wood surface color can be modified with the use of iron salts, which react with wood phenolic extractives, present as free molecules in wood porous structure. The impact of modifying wood surface color with iron salts on the final appearance of wood, including its color, grain contrast and surface roughness, was evaluated in this study. Results showed that following the application of iron (III) sulphate aqueous solutions on white oak wood surface, its roughness increased, which is due to grain raising after wetting of wood surface. The color modification of wood surface with iron (III) sulphate aqueous solutions was compared with a non-reactive water based blue stain. The contrast associated to wood grain that was expressed by the standard deviation of luminance values in wood images, also increased after application of the iron (III) sulphate aqueous solution on white oak wood surface. The comparison of contrast changes showed that wood samples stained with iron (III) sulphate on their curved surface had the highest increase in grain contrast compared to iron-stained wood showing the straight grain and to wood surfaces colored by a non-reactive water-based stain for both curved and straight grains.",0
"Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common therapeutic strategy for patients with either paroxysmal AF (PAF) or persistent AF (persAF), but long-term ablation success rates are imperfect. Maintenance of sinus rhythm immediately before ablation with antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in patients undergoing ablation. Amiodarone has superior efficacy relative to other AADs. Whether failure of amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm before ablation for either PAF or persAF is associated with poor outcomes is unknown.",1

"There is a scarcity of data evaluating contemporary real-world dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) strategies after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Methods and Results: In the OPTIVUS-Complex PCI study multivessel cohort enrolling 982 patients undergoing multivessel PCI, including left anterior descending coronary artery using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), we conducted 90-day landmark analyses to compare shorter and longer DAPT. DAPT discontinuation was defined as withdrawal of P2Y<sub>12</sub>inhibitors or aspirin for at least 2 months. The prevalence of acute coronary syndrome and high bleeding risk by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium were 14.2% and 52.5%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of DAPT discontinuation was 22.6% at 90 days, and 68.8% at 1 year. In the 90-day landmark analyses, there were no differences in the incidences of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any coronary revascularization (5.9% vs. 9.2%, log-rank P=0.12; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-1.08; P=0.09) and BARC type 3 or 5 bleeding (1.4% vs. 1.9%, log-rank P=0.62) between the off- and on-DAPT groups at 90 days.",1
"Background Oral benzodiazepines (OBZs) can facilitate treatment of dentally anxious patients and are widely used in countries such as Australia and the United States. Dentists in the UK prescribe them much less often.Aims To examine OBZ prescribing by dentists in the UK, including patterns of practice, barriers to use, and alternative anxiety management strategies.Methods An online mixed-methods survey was conducted utilising Qualtrics. Participants were recruited via the private Facebook group 'For Dentists, By Dentists' during April to June 2021. Quantitative data were analysed with descriptive statistics and qualitative data with thematic analysis.Results In total, 235 dentists participated, with 91% being general dentists. Half had previously prescribed OBZs, with 36% doing so in the last year. Only 18% were confident in their use. Diazepam was the anxiolytic preferred by respondents. Two-thirds of dentists who had never prescribed anxiolytics were interested in doing so in the future. Concerns about managing anxious patients with OBZs included: inadequate training; confusion about guidelines; medico-legal risk; and issues of general practitioners prescribing anxiolytics to dental patients unbeknown to their dentist.Conclusions A lack of confidence prescribing OBZs for anxiolysis exists among UK dentists. Guidelines should be clarified, and training provided.",0
"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used probiotics and offer promising prospects for increasing the viability of honeybees. Thus, the probiotic potential of 10 LAB strains was determined, which in our previous studies showed the most potent protective abilities. In the current study, we investigated various properties of probiotic candidates. The tested LAB strains varied in susceptibility to tested antibiotics. Isolates showed high viability in sugar syrups and gastrointestinal conditions. None of the LAB strains exhibited β-hemolytic activity, mutual antagonism, mucin degradation, hydrogen peroxide production capacity, or bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of LAB cell-free supernatants (CFS) was assessed, as well as the effect of CFS from <i>P. pentosaceus</i> 14/1 on the cytotoxicity of coumaphos and chlorpyrifos in the Caco-2 cell line. The viability of Caco-2 cells reached up to 89.81% in the presence of the highest concentration of CFS. Furthermore, LAB metabolites decreased the cytotoxicity of insecticides (up to 19.32%) thus demonstrating cytoprotective activity. All tested LAB strains produced lactic, acetic, and malonic acids. This research allowed the selection of the most effective LAB strains, in terms of probiosis, for future in vivo studies aimed at developing an ecologically protective biopreparation for honeybees.",0
"This study was aimed at the investigation of the supramolecular systems based on cationic surfactants bearing cyclic head groups (imidazolium and pyrrolidinium) and polyanions (polyacrylic acid (PAA) and human serum albumin (HSA)), and factors governing their structural behavior to create functional nanosystems with controlled properties. Research hypothesis. Mixed PE-surfactant complexes based on oppositely charged species are characterized by multifactor behavior strongly affected by the nature of both components. It was expected that the transition from a single surfactant solution to an admixture with PE might provide synergetic effects on structural characteristics and functional activity. To test this assumption, the concentration thresholds of aggregation, dimensional and charge characteristics, and solubilization capacity of amphiphiles in the presence of PEs have been determined by tensiometry, fluorescence and UV-visible spectroscopy, and dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering.",0
"Provisionally unclassified vascular anomalies (PUVA) are a group of diseases with unique characteristics that make them unclassifiable within vascular tumors or malformations. We describe a PUVA as the cause of recurrent pericardial effusion and its response to sirolimus. A 6-year-old girl was referred with a cervicothoracic vascular anomaly, a violaceous, and irregular lesion in the neck and upper chest, diagnosed as ""hemangioma"". She had pericardial effusion at the neonatal age that required pericardiocentesis, propranolol, and corticosteroids. She remained stable for 5 years, when she presented with a severe pericardial effusion. A magnetic resonance visualized a diffuse vascular image in the cervical and thoracic region with mediastinal extension. The pathological study showed a vascular proliferation in the dermis and hypodermis with positive staining for Wilms' Tumor 1 Protein (WT1) and negative for Glut-1. Genetic testing found a variant in <i>GNA14</i> , for which the diagnosis of PUVA was established. When a pericardial drain was placed without response, treatment with sirolimus was started with resolution of the effusion. Sixteen months later, the malformation is stable and there has been no recurrence of pericardial effusion. In a significant group of patients, definitive diagnosis is not possible despite pathological and genetic analysis. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors may become a therapeutic option if symptoms are severe enough, with a low rate of reported side effects.",0

"Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is an extremely unusual but potentially life-threatening condition. This condition is typically observed in individuals who are suicidal or have type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and have taken an overdose of metformin. In this case, we present the instance of a 43-year-old man who had type II DM and was addicted to oral opium.

However, prompt and effective treatment was administered, including hemodialysis and adequate hemodynamic resuscitation, leading to a successful outcome.",1
"Hypothalamic inflammation is a pathophysiological basis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), while overactivated and/or excess M1 polarized microglia are considered to be the main reason for the occurrence of hypothalamic inflammation. Therefore, <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments were performed to assess the relationships between microglia‑mediated inflammatory reactions and endocrine functions in the PCOS hypothalamus. The expression of gonadotropin‑releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor (GnRHR) was demonstrated in hypothalamic microglia, and it was found that low concentration, GnRH agonist, leuprolide acetate accelerated the expression of M2 polarization marker CD206, while high concentration leuprolide acetate increased the expression of M1 polarization marker CD86 <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, aerobic exercise not only reduced the levels of serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone and GnRH and the amount of overactivated microglia, but also increased the number of M2 microglia in the hypothalamus of letrozole‑induced PCOS rats. In combination, these results not only demonstrated the expression of GnRHR in hypothalamic microglia, but also demonstrated that GnRH can induce microglial polarization, while aerobic exercise may improve the microglia‑mediated inflammatory reaction by reducing the expression of GnRHR in the hypothalamic microglia of PCOS rats.",1

"Protracted use of paracetamol at therapeutic/toxic doses readily induces major organ toxicity and poor clinical efficacy. <i>Caesalpinia bonducella</i> seeds possess a diverse range of biological and therapeutic activities. Thus, our study aimed to scrutinize the toxic effects of paracetamol and the potential renal and intestinal protective effects of <i>Caesalpinia bonducella</i> seed extract (CBSE). To Wistar rats, CBSE was administered for 8 days (300 mg/kg, <i>p.o</i>.) with or without paracetamol (2000 mg/kg, <i>p.o.</i>) on the 8th day. Pertinent toxicity assessments in the kidney and intestine were analyzed at the end of the study. The CBASE's phytochemical components were examined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). After the study period, study findings evidenced that paracetamol intoxication induced elevation of renal enzyme indicators, oxidative damage, imbalance with the pro/anti-inflammatory production and pro/anti-apoptotic mediators, and tissue injury; all repercussions were alleviated by pre-treatment with CBASE. CBASE considerably reduced (<i>P</i> < 0.05) paracetamol-induced kidney and intestine injury by limiting caspase-8/3 signaling and amplification of inflammation in renal and intestinal tissue by significantly reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. As per the GC-MS report, three main bioactive components-Piperine, Isocaryophyllene, and Tetradec-13-en-11-yn-1-ol were predominant and have protective activities. Our study ascertains that CBSE pre-treatment exerts potent renal and intestine protection against paracetamol intoxication. Thus, CBSE could be a prospective therapeutic candidate for protecting the kidney and intestine from the severity of paracetamol intoxication.",1
"Metabolic disorders (MDs) like obesity, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes are more frequently observed in patients diagnosed with psychiatric disorders undergoing treatment with antipsychotics, particularly atypical agents, than in the general population. The second generation of antidiabetics (SGAD) has been associated with cardiovascular benefits in large clinical trials which represent an important advantage over first-generation agents and might be of interest in the psychiatric population where multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g., smoking, lack of exercise, and lack of healthy diet) are common occurrences. Therefore, this systematic review focused on the evaluation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs), as a representative of the SGAD, to determine whether these agents may be recommended in patients with psychiatric disorders and MDs. For analysis, three electronic databases and clinical trial registers were explored for papers published between January 2000 and November 2022. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 clinical and preclinical trials, therapeutic guidelines, and meta-analyses were reviewed, and clinical recommendations were formulated. The large majority of the reviewed data (nine papers) were graded 'moderate' based on the GRADE criteria. The efficacy and tolerability of liraglutide and exenatide in the management of antipsychotic-induced MDs were supported by evidence of average quality, while the results regarding other GLP-1RAs were not sufficient to formulate a recommendation for their administration in this specific population. Clozapine and olanzapine had the most negative consequences on body weight, glycemic, and lipid metabolism. Therefore, careful monitoring of metabolic parameters is required when these are prescribed. Liraglutide and exenatide may be recommended as augmentative agents to metformin therapy, especially in patients receiving these two atypical antipsychotics, but most of the reviewed data supported the efficacy of GLP-1RAs only during the treatment administration. The two follow-up studies retrieved in the literature reported modest effects after GLP-1RA discontinuation after 1 year; therefore, long-term monitoring of metabolic parameters is required. More research is needed, and three randomized clinical trials are already ongoing, to evaluate the effects of GLP-1RAs in decreasing body weight, but also on other important metabolic variables, such as HbA1c status, fasting glucose levels, and lipid levels in patients receiving antipsychotic treatment.",1
"The complex chemical composition of propolis is related to the plant source to be used by honeybees. Propolis type is defined based on the plant source with the highest proportion in its composition, which is determined by chromatographic techniques as high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). In addition to marker component identification to specify the propolis type, quantification of its proportion is also significant for prediction and reproducible pharmacological activity. One drawback for propolis marker component quantitation is that during the chromatographical analysis, not the main but the other plant sources with less proportion may cause interferences during the chemical analysis. In this study, the amounts of marker components were compared with the reference analysis data obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and from HPTLC images using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Genetic Inverse Least Squares (GILS) regression methods. Firstly, HPTLC images of propolis samples were processed by an image algorithm (developed in MATLAB) where the bands of each standard and the samples were cut same dimensional pieces as 351 × 26 pixels in height and width, respectively. Simultaneously, reference analysis of the marker components in propolis samples was performed with a validated HPLC method. Consequently, the reference values obtained from HPLC versus PLS, and GILS predicted values of the eight compounds based on the digitized HPTLC images of the chromatograms were found to be matched successfully. The results of the multivariate calibration models demonstrated that HPTLC images could be used quantitatively for quality control of propolis used as a food supplement.",0

"Empagliflozin (EMPA) is a sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitor used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and has positive effects on cardiovascular outcomes. Amitriptyline (AMT) can be used in many clinical indications but leads to cardiotoxicity by causing QT prolongation.

"Hypertension is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy, contributing to heart failure progression. Candesartan (Cand) is an angiotensin receptor antagonist widely used for hypertension treatment. Structural modifications were previously performed by our group using Zinc (ZnCand) as a strategy for improving its pharmacological properties. The measurements showed that ZnCand exerts a stronger interaction with the angiotensin II receptor, type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub> receptor), reducing oxidative stress and intracellular calcium flux, a mechanism implied in cell contraction. These results were accompanied by the reduction of the contractile capacity of mesangial cells. In vivo experiments showed that the complex causes a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure after 8 weeks of treatment in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The reduction of heart hypertrophy was evidenced by echocardiography, the histologic cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes, collagen content, the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) marker and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and the matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) expression. Besides, the complex restored the redox status. In this study, we demonstrated that the complexation with Zn(II) improves the antihypertensive and cardiac effects of the parental drug.",0

"The consumption of coffee and other caffeinated drinks is increasingly popular across the globe. In the United States, 90% of adults consume at least one caffeinated beverage a day. While caffeine consumption of up to 400 mg/d is not generally associated with negative effects on human health, the impact of caffeine on the gut microbiome and individual gut microbiota remains unclear. We examined the effect of caffeine on the growth rate of Escherichia coli, a bacterium commonly found in the human gut, when grown aerobically or anaerobically in nutrient-rich or minimal medium. A significant negative correlation was observed between caffeine concentration and growth rate under all conditions, suggesting that caffeine can act as an antimicrobial agent when ingested. Caffeine reduced growth rates significantly more in nutrient-poor, but not in anoxic, conditions. Given the highly variable nutrient and oxygen conditions of the gut, these results suggest a need to further explore caffeine's inhibitory effects on the gut microbiome and its relation to human health.",0

"Metformin has been used for ages to treat diabetes mellitus due to its safety profile and low cost. However, metformin has variable pharmacokinetics in patients, and due to its poor oral absorption, the therapeutic doses are relatively high, causing unpleasant gastrointestinal adverse effects. Therefore, novel derivatives of metformin have been synthesized during the past decades. Particularly, after the mid-2000 s, when organic cation transporters were identified as the main metformin carriers, metformin derivatives have been under intensive investigation. Nevertheless, due to the biguanide structure, derivatives of metformin have been challenging to synthesize. Moreover, the mechanisms of metformin's action are not fully understood to date, and since it has multifunctional properties, the interests have switched to re-purposing for other diseases. Indeed, metformin derivatives have been demonstrated in many cases to be more effective than metformin itself and have the potential to be used in different diseases, including several types of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, the pleiotropic nature of metformin and its derivatives can also create challenges. Not all properties are fit for all diseases. In this review, the history of the development of metformin-like compounds is summarized, and insights into their potential for future drug discovery are discussed.",1
"Despite its efficacy for treating androgenetic alopecia, finasteride, an inhibitor of 5α-reductase (i.e., the enzyme converting testosterone, T, into dihydrotestosterone, DHT), is associated with several side effects including sexual dysfunction (e.g., erectile dysfunction). These side effects may persist after drug suspension, inducing the so-called post-finasteride syndrome (PFS). The effects of subchronic treatment with finasteride (i.e., 20 days) and its withdrawal (i.e., 1 month) in rat corpus cavernosum have been explored here. Data obtained show that the treatment was able to decrease the levels of the enzyme 5α-reductase type II in the rat corpus cavernosum with increased T and decreased DHT levels. This local change in T metabolism was linked to mechanisms associated with erectile dysfunction. Indeed, by targeted metabolomics, we reported a decrease in the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, measured by the citrulline/arginine ratio and confirmed by the decrease in NO<sub>2</sub> levels, and a decrease in ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) activity, measured by citrulline/ornithine ratio. Interestingly, the T levels are negatively correlated with NOS activity, while those of DHT are positively correlated with OTC activity. Finasteride treatment also induced alterations in the levels of other molecules involved in the control of penile erection, such as norepinephrine and its metabolite, epinephrine. Indeed, plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, suggesting an impairment of these mediators. Interestingly, these modifications were restored by suspension of the drug. Altogether, the results reported here indicate that finasteride treatment, but not its withdrawal, affects T metabolism in the rat corpus cavernosum, and this alteration was linked to mechanisms associated with erectile dysfunction. Data here reported could also suggest that the PFS sexual side effects are more related to dysfunction in a sexual central control rather than peripheral compromised condition.",1

"One of the most important routes for human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is the ingestion of contaminated food. Food of animal origin safety is strongly related to feed quality. The aim of the study was the assessment of feeds and feed materials quality associated with ten PBDE congeners (BDE-28, 47, 49, 99, 100, 138, 153, 154, 183 and 209) contamination. The quality of 207 feed samples divided into eight categories (277/2012/EU) was checked using the gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). At least one congener was identified in 73% of the samples. All investigated fish oil, animal fat, and feed for fish were contaminated, and 80% of plant-origin feed samples were free of PBDEs. The highest median content of ∑<sub>10</sub>PBDE was found in fish oils (2260 ng kg<sup>-1</sup>) followed by fishmeal (530 ng kg<sup>-1</sup>). The lowest median was found in mineral feed additives, plant materials excluding vegetable oil and compound feed. BDE-209 was the most frequently detected congener (56%). All congeners except BDE-138 and BDE-183 were detected in 100% of the fish oil samples. Except for BDE-209, the congener detection frequencies did not exceed 20% in compound feed, feed of plant origin, and vegetable oils. Excluding BDE-209, similar congener profiles were found for fish oils, fishmeal and feed for fish, with BDE-47 in the highest concentration, followed by BDE-49 and BDE-100. Another pattern appeared in animal fat, with a higher median concentration of BDE-99 than BDE-47. Time-trend analysis of PBDE concentrations in fishmeal (n = 75) showed a 63% decrease in ∑<sub>10</sub>PBDE (p = 0.077) and a 50% decrease in the ∑<sub>9</sub>PBDE (p = 0.008) between 2017 and 2021. It proves the international legislation implemented to reduce PBDE environmental levels has been effective.",0
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) occurs during the reproductive period in women and is characterized by reproductive, endocrine, and metabolic disorders. Androgen plays a decisive role in its pathogenesis due to the interaction between hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance, which might be improved by selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). The present study aimed to clarify the effect of SeNPs on androgen synthesis and action in the PCOS model and the resulting effect on ovarian function. Fifty-five 7-week-old female albino rats (90-105 g) were divided equally into five groups: control (C), fed a standard diet for 11 weeks; high-fat diet (HFD) group, fed HFD for 11 weeks; HFD and letrozole (L) (HFD + L), fed HFD for 11 weeks and administrated orally with L, at a daily dose of 1 mg/kg BW, for three weeks from the 7th to 9th week of the trial; HFD + L + 0.1SeNPs and HFD + L + 0.2SeNPs groups, treated the same as HFD + L group and orally gavaged SeNPs at daily doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg BW, respectively, during the last 14 day of the experiment. Daily determination of estrous cycle was performed, and at the end of the experimental period, BMI, serum glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, lipid profile, sex hormones, TNF-α, IL6, oxidative stress biomarkers, ovarian mRNA expression of different proteins and enzymes involved in steroidogenesis, pathological examination, and immunohistochemical staining for androgen receptor (AR) were evaluated. Treatment of SeNPs restored estrous cyclicity, decreased BMI, and insulin resistance, improved dyslipidemia, reduced serum testosterone, and improved ovarian histopathology in PCOS rats. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant impacts of SeNPs were remarkably noticed. Administration of SeNPs decreased androgen synthesis and expression of ovarian AR protein by decreasing the mRNA expression of STAR, Cyp11A1, Cyp17A1, and HSD17B3 and increasing the expression of Cyp19α1. Conclusively, SeNPs decreased androgen synthesis and blocked the vicious circle initiated by excessive androgen secretion via decreased AR expression. Thus, it may effectively treat PCOS cases by eliminating its reproductive, endocrine, and metabolic dysfunctions.",0

"Protein drugs are increasingly used as therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. However, their inherent drawbacks, such as poor stability, low cell membrane and tissue permeability, lack of tumor selectivity, and severe side effects, limit their wide applications in cancer therapy. Herein, screening of a thermo-pH-sensitive polymer-glucose oxidase conjugate that can controllably self-assemble into nanoparticles with improved stability is reported. The size, surface charge, and bioactivity of the conjugate can be tuned by adjustment of the solution temperature and pH. The cellular uptake, intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation, and tumor cell spheroid penetration of the conjugate are greatly enhanced under the acidic tumor microenvironment, leading to increased cytotoxicity to tumor cells. Upon a single intratumoural injection, the conjugate penetrates into the whole tumor tissue but hardly diffuses into the normal tissues, resulting in the eradication of the tumors in mice without perceivable side effects. Simultaneously, the conjugate induces a robust antitumor immunity to efficiently inhibit the growth of distant tumors, especially in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. These findings provide a novel and general strategy to make multifunctional protein-polymer conjugates with responsiveness to the acidic tumor microenvironment for selective tumor therapy.",0
"A real-world association between direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) concentration and clinical outcomes among Asian patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is reported herein. Patients with AF aged ≥ 20 years who used DOAC for ≥ 3 days were enrolled. Trough and peak DOAC concentrations were measured and compared with the expected range reported in clinical trials. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to investigate the association between concentration and outcomes. From January 2016 to July 2022, a total of 859 patients were enrolled. Among them, 22.5%, 24.7%, 36.4%, and 16.4% were on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, respectively. Compared with clinical trials, the proportion of DOAC concentrations higher or lower than the expected range were 9.0% and 14.6% for trough, respectively, and 20.9% and 12.1% for peak, respectively. The average follow-up duration was 2.4 ± 1.6 years. The incidence of stroke and systemic thromboembolism (SSE) was 1.31 per 100-person years, and low trough concentration predicted SSE (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.78 (1.20, 6.46)). The incidence of major bleeding was 1.64 per 100-person years, and high trough was associated with major bleeding (HR = 2.63 (1.09, 6.39)). The association between peak concentration and SSE or major bleeding was nonsignificant. Off-label underdosing (odds ratio (OR) = 2.69 (1.70, 4.26)), once daily DOAC dosing (OR = 3.22 (2.07, 5.01)), and high creatinine clearance (OR = 1.02 (1.01, 1.03)) caused low trough concentration. Contrarily, congestive heart failure was significantly associated with high trough concentration (OR = 1.71 (1.01, 2.92)). In conclusion, trough DOAC concentration measurements should be considered among patients at risk of out-of-expected range DOAC concentrations.",1

"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), or gliptins, are a widely used glucose-lowering agents. A growing amount of evidence pointed to a possible role of DPP-4i in the induction of bullous pemphigoid (BP), which is an auto-immune skin blistering disease that mainly affects the elderly. In this article we discuss a case of DPP-4i associated BP and we provide an updated review of the current knowledge regarding this emerging entity. Use of DPP-4i, particularly vildagliptin, was found to significantly increase the risk of BP. BP180 would be in the center of the aberrant immune response. DPP-4i induced BP is thought to be associated with male gender, mucosal involvement, and milder inflammatory phenotype especially in Asian population. Generally, patients may not remit fully after DPP-4i withdrawal only and require either topical or systemic glucocorticoid courses.",1

With mental health pharmaceutical interventions continuing to be stigmatized and inaccessible among populations, natural supplements provide an opportunity for intervention.",0
"Infusion of lipid emulsion for drug overdose arose as a treatment for local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) initially based on laboratory results in animal models with the subsequent support of favourable case reports. Following successful translation to the clinic, practitioners also incorporated lipid emulsion as a treatment for non-local anaesthetic toxicities but without formal clinical trials. Recent clinical trials demonstrate a benefit of lipid emulsion in antipsychotic, pesticide, metoprolol and tramadol overdoses. Formal trials of lipid emulsion in LAST may never occur, but alternative analytic tools indicate strong support for its efficacy in this indication; for example, lipid emulsion has obviated the need for cardiopulmonary bypass in most cases of LAST. Herein, we describe the pre-clinical support for lipid emulsion, evaluate the most recent clinical studies of lipid emulsion for toxicity, identify a possible dose-based requirement for efficacy and discuss the limitations to uncontrolled studies in the field.",0
"The use and misuse of opioids, as well as opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased remarkably among reproductive-aged and pregnant women. As many as 25% of pregnant women who report non-medical opioid use in the past month also report concurrent alcohol use. While teratogenic effects of alcohol are well established, there are limited studies evaluating fetal intracranial effects associated with medications for OUD (MOUD) and concurrent use of MOUD and alcohol during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of MOUD, with and without concomitant alcohol use, on fetal intracranial measurements. The type of maternal MOUD therapy (methadone vs. buprenorphine) was also examined.",1
"Bisphenol S (BPS) causes reproductive adverse effects on humans and animals. However, the detailed mechanism is still unclear. This research aimed to clarify the role of RNA binding protein YTHDF1 in Leydig cell damage induced by BPS. The mouse TM3 Leydig cells were exposed to BPS of 0, 20, 40, and 80 μmol/L for 72 h. Results showed that TM3 Leydig cells apoptosis rate markedly increased in BPS exposure group. Meanwhile, the apoptosis-related molecule BCL2 protein level decreased significantly, and Caspase9, Caspase3, and BAX increased significantly. Moreover, the cell cycle was blocked in the G1/S phase, CDK2 and CyclinE1 were considerably down-regulated in BPS exposure groups, and the protein level of RNA binding protein YTHDF1 decreased sharply. Furthermore, after overexpression of YTHDF1, the cell viability significantly increased, and the apoptosis rate significantly decreased in TM3 Leydig cells. In the meantime, BCL2, CDK2, and CyclinE1 were significantly up-regulated, and BAX, Caspase9, and Caspase3 were significantly down-regulated. Conversely, interference with YTHDF1 decreased cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Importantly, overexpression of YTHDF1 alleviated the cell viability decrease induced by BPS, and interference with YTHDF1 exacerbated the situation. RIP assays showed that the binding of YTHDF1 to CDK2, CyclinE1, and BCL2 significantly increased after overexpressing YTHDF1. Collectively, our study suggested that YTHDF1 plays an essential role in BPS-induced TM3 Leydig cell damage by regulating CDK2-CyclinE1 and BCL2 mitochondrial pathway at the translational level.",0
"Due to the stratum corneum barrier, resveratrol is difficult to be absorbed transdermally, limiting its anti-aging and skin-brightening effects. Furthermore, there is a lack of systematic studies on the efficacy of resveratrol in human skin, especially in three-dimensional skin models and clinical trials. To overcome the low transdermal delivery issue, we encapsulated resveratrol into nanoliposomes using the high-pressure homogenization method to develop an efficient transdermal drug delivery system, and systematically evaluated its anti-aging and skin-brightening efficacy via cell line models, a three-dimensional skin model and human skin. The resveratrol nanoliposomes effectively improved the transdermal penetration and retention of resveratrol and enhanced cellular uptake. In addition, compared to free resveratrol, resveratrol nanoliposomes remarkably enhanced the skin-care effects by promoting the antioxidant capacity and collagen synthesis, inhibiting the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, tyrosine activity and melanin synthesis. Notably, human clinical trials proved the anti-wrinkle and skin-brightening effectiveness of resveratrol nanoliposomes. Three levels of systematic studies indicated that resveratrol nanoliposomes could be a promising transdermal drug delivery system to enhance the anti-aging and skin-brightening effects of resveratrol.",0
"One of the most brutal dictators in humanity's history, Joseph Stalin forged the Soviet Union into a massive superpower, crushing the lives of millions of his own citizens along the way. His sudden death in March 1953 from a stroke took the world by surprise and led to a frantic power struggle within the ranks of the Soviet government. In recent years, researchers have proposed that Stalin's stroke was not natural and was potentially caused by one of his lieutenants poisoning him with warfarin or a similar anticoagulant. After examining the evidence, this article concludes that both Stalin's disease course and the properties of warfarin make it highly unlikely that he was deliberately assassinated.",1
"Patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers have a higher incidence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, there is no comparison between different anticonvulsant mood stabilizers.

"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to significant mortality and morbidity, including a high incidence of related thrombotic events. There has been concern regarding hormonal contraception use during the COVID-19 pandemic, as this is an independent risk factor for thrombosis, particularly with estrogen-containing formulations. However, higher estrogen levels may be protective against severe COVID-19 disease. Evidence for risks of hormonal contraception use during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. We conducted a living systematic review that will be updated as new data emerge on the risk of thromboembolism with hormonal contraception use in patients with COVID-19.",0
"Polybrominated dibenzofurans (PBDFs) are characteristic dioxin-like products of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) photolysis. In this study, competition mechanisms of radical-based cyclization and hydrogen abstraction reactions are proposed in PBDF formation. Commonly, the <i>ortho</i> C-Br bond dissociation during photolysis generates aryl radicals, which undergo intramolecular cyclization to form PBDFs or hydrogen abstraction with hydrogen donors (such as organic solvents and water) to form lower brominated PBDEs. By using 2,4,4'-tribromodiphenyl ether (BDE-28) as the model reactant, the experimental PBDF formation ratios in various solutions are explained quantitatively by the calculated rate constants of cyclization and hydrogen abstraction reactions using the density functional theory (DFT) method. The solvent effect of pure and mixed solvents on PBDF formation is illustrated successfully. The structure-related hydrogen donation ability for hydrogen abstraction controls the bias of competition reactions and influences PBDF formation. Water resulted to be the most significant generation of PBDFs. Fulvic and humic acid display higher hydrogen donation ability than small-molecule organics due to the partitioning effect in aqueous solution. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models of the calculated rate constants for 512 cyclization and 319 hydrogen abstraction reactions using 189 PBDEs as the initial reactants in water are established, revealing the high risk of PBDF formation in aqueous solution.",0
"The impacts of polymorphic cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) 2C9 on drug interactions and the pharmacokinetics of cyclooxygenase inhibitors have attracted considerable attention. In this survey, the prescribed dosage was reduced or discontinued in 150 and 56 patients, respectively, receiving celecoxib and diclofenac prescribed alone, as recorded in a Japanese database of adverse drug events. Among the factors underlying adverse events, intrinsic drug clearance rates may be a contributing factor. The pharmacokinetically modeled plasma concentrations of celecoxib after an oral 200-mg dose increased in CYP2C9*3 homozygotes: the area under the plasma concentration curve was 4.7-fold higher than that in CYP2C9*1 homozygotes. In patients with CYP2C9*3/*3, the virtual hepatic concentrations of diclofenac after three daily 25-mg doses for a week were 11-fold higher than the plasma concentrations in subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1. The in vivo and in vitro fractions of the victim drug metabolized by a specific polymorphic P450 form is an important determining factor for estimating drug-drug interactions. Virtual hepatic and plasma exposures estimated by pharmacokinetic modeling in patients harboring the impaired CYP2C9*3 allele could represent a causal factor for adverse events induced by celecoxib or diclofenac in a manner similar to that for drug interactions.",1
Systolic blood pressure interarm difference (IAD) predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in primary prevention populations. We examined the predictive value of IAD and the effects of treatment with the combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg once daily versus aspirin 100 mg once daily according to IAD in patients with chronic coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease.,1
"To improve our understanding of how the central nervous system functions in health and disease, we report the development of an integrated chip for studying the effects of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin on adult rat hippocampal progenitor cell (AHPC) neurospheroids. This chip allows dopamine or serotonin located in one chamber to diffuse to AHPC neurospheroids cultured in an adjacent chamber through a built-in diffusion barrier created by an array of intentionally misaligned micropillars. The gaps among the micropillars are filled with porous poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) gel to tune the permeability of the diffusion barrier. An electrochemical sensor is also integrated within the chamber where the neurospheroids can be cultured, thereby allowing monitoring of the concentrations of dopamine or serotonin. Experiments show that concentrations of the neurotransmitters inside the neurospheroid chamber can be increased over a period of several hours to over 10 days by controlling the compositions of the PEG gel inside the diffusion barrier. The AHPC neurospheroids cultured in the chip remain highly viable following dopamine or serotonin treatment. Cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation have also been observed following treatment, revealing that the AHPC neurospheroids are a valuable <i>in vitro</i> brain model for neurogenesis research. Finally, we show that by tuning the permeability of diffusion barrier, we can block transfer of <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells across the diffusion barrier, while allowing dopamine or serotonin to pass through. These results suggest the feasibility of using the chip to better understand the interactions between microbiota and brain <i>via</i> the gut-brain axis.",0
"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a neuropsychiatric disease closely related to life-threatening events and psychological stress. Re-experiencing, hyperarousal, avoidance, and numbness are the hallmark symptoms of PTSD, but their underlying neurological processes have not been clearly elucidated. Therefore, the identification and development of drugs for PTSD that targets brain neuronal activities have stalled. Considering that the persistent fear memory induced by traumatic stimulation causes high alertness, high arousal, and cognitive impairment of PTSD symptoms. While the midbrain dopamine system can affect physiological processes such as aversive fear memory learning, consolidation, persistence, and extinction, by altering the functions of the dopaminergic neurons, our viewpoint is that the dopamine system plays a considerable role in the PTSD occurrence and acts as a potential therapeutic target of the disorder. This paper reviews recent findings on the structural and functional connections between ventral tegmental area neurons and the core synaptic circuits involved in PTSD, gene polymorphisms related to the dopamine system that confer susceptibility to clinical PTSD. Moreover, the progress of research on medications that target the dopamine system as PTSD therapies is also discussed. Our goal is to offer some hints for early detection and assist in identifying novel, efficient approaches for treating PTSD.",0
"This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). A total of 3528 consecutive patients with ACS treated with PPCI were divided into the ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups based on their dual antiplatelet therapy regimen at hospital discharge. Patient follow-up visits were completed 1, 6, and 12 months after PPCI treatment. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) bleeding events were assessed in both groups. In total, 2501 cases were included in the ticagrelor group, and 817 cases were included in the clopidogrel group. The incidence of MACEs was lower in the ticagrelor group than in the clopidogrel group (P < .05). The ticagrelor group had lower incidence of all-cause death and cardiac death compared with the clopidogrel group, and the difference was significant (P < .05). The incidences of study end points, including recurrent myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization, were not significantly different between the groups (P > .05). The incidences of BARC total and major bleeding events were not significantly different between the groups (P > .05). However, the incidences of BARC type 1 and 2 bleeding events were lower in the ticagrelor group than in the clopidogrel group (P < .05). The multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that ticagrelor could decrease all-cause death compared with clopidogrel (P = .021). In patients with ACS treated with PPCI, ticagrelor could significantly reduce the risk of MACEs compared with clopidogrel, without increasing the risk of bleeding.",1

"Preterm premature rupture of membranes accounts for approximately one-quarter of all preterm deliveries and occurs in 2% to 3% of all pregnancies. With subclinical infection being a suspected cause of preterm premature rupture of membranes, the administration of prophylactic antibiotics is an accepted standard of care to extend the latency period. Historically, erythromycin was used in the antibiotic regimen recommended for women with preterm premature rupture of membranes during expectant management; however, azithromycin has recently been shown to be a suitable alternative.",1
"Studies on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles and epidemiological affirmation for AMR transmission are limited in fisheries and aquaculture settings. Since 2015, based on Global Action Plan on AMR by World Health Organization (WHO) and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), several initiatives have been under taken to enhance the knowledge, skills and capacity to establish AMR trends through surveillance and strengthening of epidemiological evidence. The focus of this study was to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), its resistance profiles and molecular characterization with respect to phylogroups, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), virulence genes (VGs), quaternary ammonium compounds resistance (QAC) genes and plasmid typing in retail market fishes. Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to understand the genetic lineage of the two most important Enterobacteriaceae members, E. coli and Klebsiella sp. was performed. 94 fish samples were collected from three different sites viz., Silagrant (S1), Garchuk (S2) and North Guwahati Town Committee (NGTC) Region (S3) in Guwahati, Assam. Out of the 113 microbial isolates from the fish samples, 45 (39.82%) were E. coli; 23 (20.35%) belonged to Klebsiella genus. Among E. coli, 48.88% (n = 22) of the isolates were alerted by the BD Phoenix M50 instrument as ESBL, 15.55% (n = 7) as PCP and 35.55% (n = 16) as non-ESBL. E. coli (39.82%) was the most prevalent pathogen among the Enterobacteriaceae members screened and showed resistance to ampicillin (69%) followed by cefazoline (64%), cefotaxime (49%) and piperacillin (49%). In the present study, 66.66% of E. coli and 30.43% of Klebsiella sp. were categorized as multi drug resistance (MDR) bacteria. CTX-M-gp-1, with CTX-M-15 variant (47%), was the most widely circulating beta-lactamase gene, while other ESBL genes bla<sub>TEM</sub> (7%), bla<sub>SHV</sub> (2%) and bla<sub>OXA-1-like</sub> (2%) were also identified in E. coli. Out of the 23 isolates of Klebsiella, 14(60.86%) were ampicillin (AM)-resistant (11(47.82%) K. oxytoca, 3(13.04%) K. aerogenes), whereas 8(34.78%) isolates of K. oxytoca showed intermediate resistance to AM. All Klebsiella isolates were susceptible to AN, SCP, MEM and TZP, although two K. aerogenes were resistant to imipenem. DHA and LAT genes were detected, respectively, in 7(16%) and 1(2%) of the E. coli strains while a single K. oxytoca (4.34%) isolate carried MOX, DHA and bla<sub>CMY-2</sub> genes. The fluoroquinolone resistance genes identified in E. coli included qnrB (71%), qnrS (84%), oqxB (73%) and aac(6)-Ib-cr (27%); however, in Klebsiella, these genes, respectively, had a prevalence of 87%, 26%, 74% and 9%. The E. coli isolates belonged to phylogroup A(47%), B1(33%) and D(14%). All of the 22(100%) ESBL E. coli had chromosome-mediated disinfectant resistance genes viz., ydgE, ydgF, sugE(c), mdfA while 82% of ESBL E. coli had emrE. Among the non-ESBL E. coli isolates, 87% of them showed the presence of ydgE, ydgF and sugE(c) genes, while 78% of the isolates had mdfA and 39% had emrE genes respectively. 59% of the ESBL and 26% of the non-ESBL E. coli had showed the presence of qacEΔ1. The sugE(p) was present in 27% of the ESBL-producing E. coli and in 9% of non-ESBL isolates. Out of the 3 ESBL-producing Klebsiella isolates, 2(66.66%) K. oxytoca isolates were found harboring plasmid-mediated qacEΔ1 gene while one (33.33%) K. oxytoca isolate had sugE(p) gene. IncFI was the most prevalent plasmid type detected in the isolates studied, with A/C (18%), P (14%), X, Y (9% each) and I1-Iγ (14%, 4%). 50% (n = 11) of the ESBL and 17% (n = 4) of the non-ESBL E. coli isolates harboured IncFIB and 45% (n = 10) ESBL and one (4.34%) non-ESBL E. coli isolates harboured IncFIA. Dominance of E. coli over other Enterobacterales and diverse phylogenetic profiles of E. coli and Klebsiella sp. suggests the possibility of contamination and this may be due to compromised hygienic practices along the supply chain and contamination of aquatic ecosystem. Continuous surveillance in domestic markets must be a priority in addressing antimicrobial resistance in fishery settings and to identify any unwarranted epidemic clones of E. coli and Klebsiella that can challenge public health sector.",0
"The electrochemical behavior of the immobilized tyrosinase (Tyrase) on a modified glassy carbon electrode with carboxymethyl starch-<i>graft</i>-polyaniline/multi-walled carbon nanotubes nanocomposite (CMS-<i>g</i>-PANI@MWCNTs) was investigated. The molecular properties of CMS-<i>g</i>-PANI@MWCNTs nanocomposite and its morphological characterization were examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A simple drop-casting method was employed to immobilize Tyrase on the CMS-<i>g</i>-PANI@MWCNTs nanocomposite. In the cyclic voltammogram (CV), a pair of redox peaks were observed at the potentials of +0.25 to -0.1 V and E°' was equal to 0.1 V and the apparent rate constant of electron transfer (K<sub>s</sub>) was calculated at 0.4 s<sup>-1</sup>. Using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), the sensitivity and selectivity of the biosensor were investigated. The biosensor exhibits linearity towards catechol and L-dopa in the concentration range of 5-100 and 10-300 μM with a sensitivity of 2.4 and 1.11 μA μΜ<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> and limit of detection (LOD) 25 and 30 μM, respectively. The Michaelis-Menten constant (K<sub>m</sub>) was calculated at 42 μΜ for catechol and 86 μΜ for L-dopa. After 28 working days, the biosensor provided good repeatability and selectivity, and maintained 67% of its stability. The existence of -COO<sup>-</sup> and -OH groups in carboxymethyl starch, -NH<sub>2</sub> groups in polyaniline, and high surface-to-volume ratio and electrical conductivity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the CMS-<i>g</i>-PANI@MWCNTs nanocomposite cause good Tyrase immobilization on the surface of the electrode.",0

"Tardive dystonia occurs after exposure, over months to years, to antipsychotics and other drugs that block dopaminergic receptors. Anterocollis is a rare form of cervical dystonia which is usually disabling for the patient. Here, we present the case of a 61-year-old woman with Alzheimer's dementia diagnosed eight years ago who was previously medicated with antipsychotics. Two years before admission, she was medicated with olanzapine. She presented to the emergency room with a sustained flexion posture of the neck that was difficult to feed. She had a marked and fixed anterocollis and severe akathisia. After the administration of propofol to perform computerized tomography, the abnormal posture disappeared. Subsequently, she was started on biperiden without improvement. One week later, olanzapine was suspended, and she was progressively started on propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and tetrabenazine. Cervical posture improved, but two weeks later, she presented with a left laterocollis, which allowed feeding, and improvement of akathisia. We present a case of tardive dystonia supported by the beginning of dystonia five months after olanzapine administration and improvement after its suspension. The coexistence of degenerative pathology is a risk factor for dystonia, which often persists despite the suspension of the causative agent. Therefore, non-pharmacological treatment and approach with antipsychotics with a better profile of extrapyramidal effects should be preferred in patients with dementia.",1
"In the past two decades, substantial advances have been made on the asymmetric alkyne functionalization by the activation of inert alkynes. However, these asymmetric transformations have so far been mostly limited to transition metal catalysis, and chiral Brønsted acid-catalyzed examples are rarely explored. Here, we report a chiral Brønsted acid-catalyzed dearomatization reaction of phenol- and indole-tethered homopropargyl amines, allowing the practical and atom-economical synthesis of a diverse array of valuable fused polycyclic enones and indolines bearing a chiral quaternary carbon stereocenter and two contiguous stereogenic centers in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and generally excellent enantioselectivities (up to >99% enantiomeric excess). This protocol demonstrates Brønsted acid-catalyzed asymmetric dearomatizations via vinylidene-quinone methides.",0
"<i>O-N</i>-Acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) can catalyze the <i>O</i>-GlcNAc modification of thousands of proteins. The holoenzyme formation of OGT and adaptor protein is the precondition for further recognition and glycosylation of the target protein, while the corresponding mechanism is still open. Here, static and dynamic schemes based on statistics can successfully screen the feasible identifying, approaching, and binding mechanism of OGT and its typical adaptor protein p38α. The most favorable interface, energy contribution of hotspots, and conformational changes of fragments were discovered. The hydrogen bond interactions were verified as the main driving force for the whole process. The distinct characteristic of active and inactive p38α is explored and demonstrates that the phosphorylated tyrosine and threonine will form strong ion-pair interactions with Lys714, playing a key role in the dynamic identification stage. Multiple method combinations from different points of view may be helpful for exploring other systems of the protein-protein interactions.",0
"Despite extensive use of micelles in materials and colloidal science, their supramolecular organization as well as host-guest interactions within these dynamic assemblies are poorly understood. Small guest molecules in the presence of micelles undergo constant exchange between a micellar aggregate and the surrounding solution, posing a considerable challenge for their molecular level characterisation. In this work we reveal the interaction maps between small guest molecules and surfactants forming micelles via novel applications of NMR techniques supported with state-of-the-art analytical methods used in colloidal science. Model micelles composed of structurally distinct surfactants (block non-ionic polymer Pluronic® F-127, non-ionic surfactant Tween 20 or Tween 80, and ionic surfactant sodium lauryl sulphate, SLS) were selected and loaded with model small molecules of biological relevance (i.e. the drugs fluconazole, FLU or indomethacin, IMC) known to have different partition coefficients. Molecular level organization of FLU or IMC within hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of micellar aggregates was established using the combination of NMR methods (1D <sup>1</sup>H NMR, 1D <sup>19</sup>F NMR, 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H NOESY and 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>19</sup>F HOESY, and the multifrequency-STD NMR) and corroborated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This is the first application of multifrequency-STD NMR to colloidal systems, enabling us to elucidate intricately detailed patterns of drug/micelle interactions in a single NMR experiment within minutes. Importantly, our results indicate that flexible surfactants, such as block copolymers and polysorbates, form micellar aggregates with a surface composed of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains and do not follow the classical core-shell model of the micelle. We propose that the magnitude of changes in <sup>1</sup>H chemical shifts corroborated with interaction maps obtained from DEEP-STD NMR and 2D NMR experiments can be used as an indicator of the strength of the guest-surfactant interactions. This NMR toolbox can be adopted for the analysis of broad range of colloidal host-guest systems from soft materials to biological systems.",0
"Counterfeit drugs are a global problem that is directly related to the safety and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy. The black market for counterfeit products is constantly growing and related to the wide availability through online shopping. Therefore, there is a constant need to develop analytical methods that would allow for the unambiguous identification of counterfeit products from the original ones. One of such techniques is solid-state NMR spectroscopy, which allows for direct registration and analysis of spectra of multicomponent solid forms of pharmaceutical formulations. The paper explores the possibility of using this technique in the identification of counterfeit Viagra tablets. In this study, solid-state NMR has been used to detect the non-pharmacopoeial cellulose present in the samples of counterfeit Viagra tablets. Besides, the NMR results allowed to develop a rapid dying technique that can be used to distinguish between the counterfeit and original drug. It has been shown that solid-state NMR spectroscopy allows for numerous analyses such as identification of counterfeit products, assessment of the composition of analyte, estimation of qualitative differences between the original and falsified product, and the development of simple analytical methods based on tablets composition differences.",0
"The benzene ligand at CpV(η<sup>6</sup> -C<sub>6</sub> H<sub>6</sub> ) (1) is exchanged for pentafulvenes. Using sterically demanding pentafulvenes gives a clean exchange reaction, yielding vanadium pentafulvene (2 a and 2 b) and benzofulvene complexes (3 a and 3 b). The molecular structures of the target compounds suggest a π-η<sup>5</sup> :σ-η<sup>1</sup> coordination mode with a vanadium<sup>III</sup> center. With the sterically low demanding 6,6-dimethylpentafulvene, a C-H activation at the leaving ligand is observed, yielding the ring-substituted vanadocene<sup>II</sup> 4. The reactivity of the pentafulvene complexes was investigated. A series of unprecedented vanadocene<sup>III</sup> compounds were synthesized: Under mild conditions, E-H splitting of 4-tert-butylphenol, diphenylamine, and 2,6-diisopropylaniline yield well characterized examples of rare vanadocene<sup>III</sup> phenolate and amide complexes. Insertion reactions into the V-C<sub>exo</sub> bond of the pentafulvene complexes by multiple bond containing substrates were found for acetone, 4-chlorobenzonitril and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.",0
"Antibiotics are increasingly used and released into the marine environment due to the rapid development of mariculture, resulting in spread of antibiotic resistance. The pollution, distribution, and characteristics of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbiomes have been investigated in this study. Results showed that 20 antibiotics were detected in Chinese coastal environment, with predominance of erythromycin-H<sub>2</sub>O, enrofloxacin and oxytetracycline. In coastal mariculture sites, antibiotic concentrations were significantly higher than in control sites, and more types of antibiotics were detected in the South than in the North of China. Residues of enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and sulfadiazine posed high resistance selection risks. β-Lactam, multi-drug and tetracycline resistance genes were frequently detected with significantly higher abundance in the mariculture sites. Of the 262 detected ARGs, 10, 26, and 19 were ranked as high-risk, current-risk, future-risk, respectively. The main bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, of which 25 genera were zoonotic pathogens, with Arcobacter and Vibrio in particular ranking in the top10. Opportunistic pathogens were more widely distributed in the northern mariculture sites. Phyla of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the potential hosts of high-risk ARGs, while the conditional pathogens were associated with future-risk ARGs, indicating a potential threat to human health.",0
"The strategies to relieve antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) pollution are urgently needed. Fermentation broth from fruit and vegetable waste (FFVW), an agricultural amendment, exhibits a remarkable capacity to reduce ARG pollution; however, the underlying mechanism of this effect remains unclear. We performed microcosm experiments to reappear the phenomenon of FFVW-driven reduction in ARGs. Moderate-level FFVW reduced gene resistance to sulfonamide (41.2 %), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) (47.2 %), chloramphenicol (63.2 %), and tetracycline (61.4 %). Binning and network analyses revealed that Actinobacteria comprise the primary hosts of ARGs in arable soil, and FFVW substantially inhibited the growth and metabolic activity of these organisms. Moreover, tetracycline and MLS production was partially/completely inhibited by FFVW, further reducing the transfer frequency by 52.9-86.1 % and 46.6-66.6 % in the intragenic and intergenic mating systems, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of genes related to conjugation pairing and plasmid transfer was downregulated. Thus, FFVW effectively reduces ARG pollution by inhibiting Actinobacteria proliferation, thereby reducing selective pressure and restricting horizontal gene transfer. Our findings highlight the important underlying mechanisms of FFVW involved in ARG reduction, supporting its use in arable soil.",0
"The aim of this study was to present the first nation-wide, systematic, repeated assessment of doctor-shopping (i.e. visiting multiple physicians to be prescribed the same drug) during 10 years for more than 200 psychoactive prescription drugs in the 67 million inhabitants in France.",0
"Colorectal carcinogenesis coincides with immune cell dysfunction. Metformin has been reported to play a role in stimulating antitumor immunity, suggesting it could be used to overcome immunosuppression in colorectal cancer. Herein, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we showed that metformin remodels the immune landscape of colorectal cancer. In particular, metformin treatment expanded the proportion of CD8+ T cells and potentiated their function. Analysis of the metabolic activities of cells in the colorectal cancer tumor microenvironment (TME) at a single-cell resolution demonstrated that metformin reprogrammed tryptophan metabolism, which was reduced in colorectal cancer cells and increased in CD8+ T cells. Untreated colorectal cancer cells outcompeted CD8+ T cells for tryptophan, leading to impaired CD8+ T-cell function. Metformin in turn reduced tryptophan uptake by colorectal cancer cells, thereby restoring tryptophan availability for CD8+ T cells and increasing their cytotoxicity. Metformin inhibited tryptophan uptake in colorectal cancer cells by downregulating MYC, which led to a reduction in the tryptophan transporter SLC7A5. This work highlights metformin as an essential regulator of T-cell antitumor immunity by reprogramming tryptophan metabolism, suggesting it could be a potential immunotherapeutic strategy for treating colorectal cancer.",0
"Recent studies have demonstrated that ovarian granular cells (OGCs) pyroptosis is present in the ovaries of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) mice and that NLRP3 activation destroys follicular functions. Metformin has been shown to protect against PCOS by reducing insulin resistance in women, whereas its role in OGC pyroptosis is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the impact of metformin on OGC pyroptosis and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that treating a human granulosa-like tumor cell line (KGN) with metformin significantly decreased LPS-induced expression of miR-670-3p, NOX2, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, and GSDMD-N. Cellular caspase-1 activity; ROS production; oxidative stress; and the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α were also diminished. These effects were amplified by adding N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a pharmacological inhibitor of ROS. In contrast, metformin's anti-pyroptosis and anti-inflammatory effects were robustly ameliorated by NOX2 overexpression in KGN cells. Moreover, bioinformatic analyses, RT-PCR, and Western blotting showed that miR-670-3p could directly bind to the NOX2 (encoded by the CYBB gene in humans) 3'UTR and decrease NOX2 expression. Metformin-induced suppression of NOX2 expression, ROS production, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis was significantly alleviated by transfection with the miR-670-3p inhibitor. These findings suggest that metformin inhibits KGN cell pyroptosis via the miR-670-3p/NOX2/ROS pathway.",0
"Combining biomacromolecules with green chemistry principles and clean technologies has proven to be an effective approach for drug delivery, providing a prolonged and sustained release of the encapsulated material. The current study investigates the potential of cholinium caffeate (Ch[Caffeate]), a phenolic-based biocompatible ionic liquid (Bio-IL) entrapped in alginate/acemannan beads, as a drug delivery system able to reduce local joint inflammation on osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. The synthesized Bio-IL has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions that, combined with biopolymers as 3D architectures, promote the entrapment and sustainable release of the bioactive molecules over time. The physicochemical and morphological characterization of the beads (ALC, ALAC0,5, ALAC1, and ALAC3, containing 0, 0.5, 1, and 3 %(w/v) of Ch[Caffeate], respectively) revealed a porous and interconnected structure, with medium pore sizes ranging from 209.16 to 221.30 μm, with a high swelling ability (up 2400 %). Ch[Caffeate] significantly improved the antioxidant activities of the constructs by 95 % and 97 % for ALAC1 and ALAC3, respectively, when compared to ALA (56 %). Besides, the structures provided the environment for ATDC5 cell proliferation, and cartilage-like ECM formation, supported by the increased GAGs in ALAC1 and ALAC3 formulations after 21 days. Further, the ability to block the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), from differentiated THP-1 was evidenced by ChAL-Ch[Caffeate] beads. These outcomes suggest that the established strategy based on using natural and bioactive macromolecules to develop 3D constructs has great potential to be used as therapeutic tools for patients with OA.",0
"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an integral part of many anticancer therapies. Fenton-like processes involving reactions of peroxides with transition metal ions are a particularly potent and tunable subset of ROS approaches. Precise on-demand dosing of the Fenton reaction is an area of great interest. Herein, we present a concept of an electrochemical faradaic pixel that produces controlled amounts of ROS via a Fenton-like process. The pixel comprises a cathode and anode, where the cathode reduces dissolved oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The anode is made of chromium, which is electrochemically corroded to yield chromium ions. Peroxide and chromium interact to form a highly oxidizing mixture of hydroxyl radicals and hexavalent Cr ions. After benchmarking the electrochemical properties of this type of device, we demonstrate how it can be used under in vitro conditions with a cancer cell line. The faradaic Fenton pixel is a general and scalable concept that can be used for on-demand delivery of redox-active products for controlling a physiological outcome.",0
"Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is caused by cystathionine β-synthase deficiency leading to impaired homocysteine transsulfuration and accumulation of homocysteine and methionine. Patients present with a wide spectrum of manifestations including ocular, skeletal, neuropsychiatric, and vascular manifestations. We report a 48-year-old female with pyridoxine-unresponsive HCU treated with betaine, cyanocobalamin, and folate. Her diet was non-restricted due to intolerance of low-methionine diet. She was admitted to hospital following a fall, with multiple fractures and subsequently developed acute liver failure with encephalopathy. Shock, sepsis, and liver ischaemia/thrombosis were excluded. In the context of glutathione depletion expected in HCU, hepatic dysfunction was presumed to be due to iatrogenic paracetamol toxicity, despite paracetamol intake at conventional therapeutic dose, with role of hypermethioninemia as a contributing factor being uncertain. Betaine was discontinued on hospital admission. <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion was initiated. Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) was 3.4 μmol/L 9 days following initiation of NAC treatment with a markedly elevated plasma methionine of 1278 μmol/L. tHcy concentration returned to pre-admission baseline after NAC was discontinued. Recovery following this episode was slow with a prolonged cholestatic phase and gradual improvement in jaundice and coagulopathy. We recommend that paracetamol should be administered cautiously in HCU patients due to underlying glutathione depletion and risk of toxicity even at therapeutic doses. NAC is clearly effective in lowering tHcy in classical HCU in the short-term however further research is required to assess clinical efficacy and use as a potential therapy in classical HCU.",1
"Fluorescent bovine serum albumin-protected gold nanoclusters (BSA@Au NCs) can catalyze the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to produce blue oxTMB for its peroxidase-like activity. The two absorption peaks of oxTMB overlapped with the excitation and emission peaks of BSA@Au NCs, respectively, causing efficient quenching on the fluorescence of BSA@Au NCs. The quenching mechanism can be attributed to the dual inner filter effect (IFE). Based on the dual IFE, BSA@Au NCs were utilized as both peroxidase mimics and fluorescent reporters for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> detection and further for uric acid detection with uricase. Under optimal detection conditions, the method can be used to detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ranging 0.50-50 μM with a detection limit of 0.44 μM and UA ranging 0.50-50 μM with a detection limit of 0.39 μM. The established method had been successfully utilized for the determination of UA in human urine, with massive potential in biomedical applications.",0
"Living probiotics secrete bioactive substances to accelerate wound healing, but the clinical application of antibiotics inhibits the survival of probiotics. Inspired by the chelation of tannic acid and ferric ions, we developed a metal-phenolic self-assembly shielded probiotic (<i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, <i>L. reuteri</i>@FeTA) to prevent interference from antibiotics. Here, a superimposing layer was formed on the surface of <i>L. reuteri</i> to adsorb and inactivate antibiotics. These shielded probiotics were loaded into an injectable hydrogel (Gel/L@FeTA) formed by carboxylated chitosan and oxidized hyaluronan. The Gel/L@FeTA aided the survival of probiotics and supported the continuous secretion of lactic acid to perform biological functions in an environment containing gentamicin. Furthermore, the Gel/L@FeTA hydrogels presented a better performance than the Gel/L in inflammatory regulation, angiogenesis, and tissue regeneration both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in the presence of antibiotics. Hence, a new method for designing probiotic-based biomaterials for clinical wound management is provided.",0

"In the aim to determine neurotoxicity, new methods are being validated, including tests and test batteries comprising in vitro and in vivo approaches. Alternative test models such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo have received increasing attention, with minor modifications of the fish embryo toxicity test (FET; OECD TG 236) as a tool to assess behavioral endpoints related to neurotoxicity during early developmental stages. The spontaneous tail movement assay, also known as coiling assay, assesses the development of random movement into complex behavioral patterns and has proven sensitive to acetylcholine esterase inhibitors at sublethal concentrations. The present study explored the sensitivity of the assay to neurotoxicants with other modes of action (MoAs). Here, five compounds with diverse MoAs were tested at sublethal concentrations: acrylamide, carbaryl, hexachlorophene, ibuprofen, and rotenone. While carbaryl, hexachlorophene, and rotenone consistently induced severe behavioral alterations by ~ 30 h post fertilization (hpf), acrylamide and ibuprofen expressed time- and/or concentration-dependent effects. At 37-38 hpf, additional observations revealed behavioral changes during dark phases with a strict concentration-dependency. The study documented the applicability of the coiling assay to MoA-dependent behavioral alterations at sublethal concentrations, underlining its potential as a component of a neurotoxicity test battery.",1
"Ventricular remodeling (VR) after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is an important predictor for medium- and long-term prognosis. This study focuses on the relevant indexes of VR in patients with AMI, in which, the intervention effects of sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril were compared, guiding the clinical treatment. 58 patients with acute STEMI treated with PCI were divided into research group and control group. UCG was performed at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after MI, and the patients' indexes were collected to compare VR and adverse reactions in the two groups. The test results showed that there was no statistical difference in the baseline data of patients in the two groups, which were comparable. In the blood biochemical index examination, no statistical difference was found in cTnI and NT-proBNP between the two groups. At 1 week after operation, the levels of cTnI and NT-proBNP in research group were lower than those in the control group. In ECG examination, there was no statistical significance in the levels of LVEF, LVEDD and LVESD at admission between the two groups. After 1 week, the results of LVEF, LVEDD, LVESD in the research group were higher than those in the control group. The results of this study show that sacubitril/valsartan can be used in patients with AMI instead of enalapril. Sacubitril/valsartan improves cardiac function in patients with emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for AMI, inhibits ventricular remodeling, and has a low incidence of adverse cardiac events and adverse drug reactions.",1
"Biopolymers with excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability show great potential for designing drug nanocarriers, while it's difficult to fabricate smart vehicles with multiple switching (size, surface, shape) based on biopolymers alone. Here, we report a dual size/charge-switchable and multi-responsive doxorubicin-loaded gelatin-based nanocluster (DOX-icluster) for improved tumor penetration and targeted anti-tumor therapy. The DOX-icluster was electrostatically assembled from folic acid and dimethylmaleic anhydride modified gelatin (FA-GelDMA) and small-sized DOX-loaded NH<sub>2</sub> modified hollow mesoporous organosilicon nanoparticles (DOX-HMON-NH<sub>2</sub>). DOX-icluster had an initial size of about 199 nm at neutral pH. After accumulation in tumor tissue, the DMA bond of FA-GelDMA was cleaved and gelatin was degraded by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2), thus 48 nm and positively charged DOX-HMON-NH<sub>2</sub> was released to facilitate penetration and cell internalization. DOX-HMON-NH<sub>2</sub> was further degraded by intracellular glutathione (GSH) with releasing 48.1 % of DOX. The cellular uptake results indicated that the fabricated icluster promoted the uptake of DOX by 4T1 cells. With enhanced penetration efficacy, the tumor spheroids volume treated with DOX-icluster was reduced to 15.1 % on day 7. This cytocompatible multi-responsive gelatin-based icluster with size-shrinking and charge-reversible characteristics may be used as a significant drug carrier for tumor therapy.",0
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common central nervous system tumor and is associated with poor outcomes. There have been no significant improvements in GBM mortality in recent decades. ER-α36 is a variant of ER-α66 that may be involved in carcinoma growth and proliferation via genomic and nongenomic mechanisms. This variant might play an essential role in tamoxifen resistance of several tumors. Previously, our laboratory found that ER-α36 is expressed in GBM and participates in proliferation; nevertheless, the role of ER-α36 in GBM invasion remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the effects of the ER-α36 modulator SNG162 on GBM growth and invasion. U251 cells, U87cells, and U87-36KD cells with knockdown of ER-α36 expression were cultured under the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional (3D) environments. GBM cells growth was examined by cell counting, flow cytometry, western blot, and MTT assays. Invasiveness was measured using confocal microscopy in the 3D environment. Growth of U87 cells with downregulated EGFR and ER-α36 expression was significantly reduced after treatment with 1 µM, 3 µM, and 5 µM of SNG162; growth inhibition in U251 cells was more potent than in U87 cells, although the expression level of ER-α36 in U251 cells was lower than in U87 cells. We found that 1 μM SNG162 suppressed E<sub>2</sub>-induced MAPK/ERK pathway activation in U87 cells. We also showed that SNG162 inhibited U87 cells invasion; however, it did not significantly affect U251 and U87-36KD cells invasion using the 3D culture method. Finally, we determined that ER-α36 was expressed in the nucleus of invading GBM cells, and SNG162 significantly inhibited the expression of ER-α36 in these cells. SNG162 inhibited the expression of EGFR on cell membranes of non-invasive GBM cells. These results suggest that SNG162 could be a therapeutic agent for GBM by targeting ER-α36.",0
"<i>Sedum adenotrichum</i> (SA) has been traditionally used against various ailments due to the presence of several important phenolic compounds. This study provides a scientific basis for the hepatoprotective and nephroprotective potentials of <i>Sedum adenotrichum</i> in paracetamol-induced toxicity in rabbits. Methanolic extract of <i>Sedum adenotrichum</i> along with paracetamol was administered orally to rabbits alone or in combination with paracetamol for 2 weeks. Results showed that paracetamol-induced toxicity was correlated with a significant change in biochemical, hematological parameters, and loss in body weight of rabbits, and the curative effect of SA methanolic extract was found. Liver and kidney histological studies showed significant induced toxicity of paracetamol and correspondence restoration power of SA methanolic extract. The levels of reduced glutathione, radical scavenging activity, and lipid peroxidation in the liver were restored to normal by the methanolic extract of SA. This study confirmed the protective effect of SA methanolic extract against hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity caused by paracetamol. Biochemical analysis of the methanolic extract of SA confirmed the presence of bioactive phenolic compounds which have hepatic and nephroprotective potentials.",1
"Half the US population uses drugs with anticholinergic properties. Their potential harms may outweigh their benefits. Amitriptyline is among the most frequently prescribed anticholinergic medicinal products, is used for multiple indications, and rated as strongly anticholinergic. Our objective was to explore and quantify (anticholinergic) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients taking amitriptyline vs. placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults and healthy individuals.",1
"Green Liver Systems employ the ability of macrophytes to take up, detoxify (biotransform), and bioaccumulate pollutants; however, these systems require optimization to target specific pollutants. In the present study, the aim was to test the applicability of the Green Liver System for diclofenac remediation considering the effects of selected variables. As a starting point, 42 macrophyte life forms were evaluated for diclofenac uptake. With the three best performing macrophytes, the system efficiency was evaluated at two diclofenac concentrations, one environmentally relevant and that other significantly higher (10 µg/L and 150 µg/L) and in two system sizes (60 L and 1000 L) as well as at three flow rates (3, 7, and 15 L/min). The effect of single species and combinations on removal efficiency was also considered. The highest internalization percentage was recorded in Ceratophyllum spp., Myriophyllum spp., and Egeria densa. Phytoremediation efficiency with species combinations was far superior to utilizing only a single macrophyte type. Furthermore, the results indicate that the flow rate significantly affected the removal efficiency of the pharmaceutical tested, with the highest remediation efficiency obtained with the highest flow rate. System size did not significantly affect phytoremediation; however, increase diclofenac concentration reduced the systems performance significantly. When planning the setup of a Green Liver System for wastewater remediation, basic knowledge about the water, i.e., pollutant types and flow, must be utilized during planning to optimize remediation. Various macrophytes show diverse uptake efficiencies for different contaminants and should be selected based on the pollutant composition of the wastewater.",0
"A comparative in vitro study of the antioxidant potential of natural phenols (zingerone, curcumin, raspberry ketone, magnolol) and their synthesized derivatives was performed. The antioxidant efficiency was evaluated in blood serum obtained from healthy individuals, by means of spectrophotometry, before and after the addition of pro-oxidant <i>tert</i>-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH). Moreover, the antioxidant effect of an equimolar mixture of curcumin and zingerone was investigated. Interpretation of our results reveals that in the blood serum of healthy individuals curcumin (C1), raspberry ketone (RK1), magnolol (M1) and synthesized derivative of zingerone (Z2) demonstrate remarkable antioxidant effects (<i>p</i> < 0.05). However, in the state of TBH-induced excessive oxidative stress natural magnolol and synthesized derivatives C1, Z1 and RK1 show powerful antioxidant activity and thus can be further investigated to obtain information about their metabolic transformations and their potential influence at the cellular level. Results obtained from measurements in an equimolar mixture of zingerone and curcumin indicate synergism (<i>p</i> < 0.05) between the two compounds. This combination is especially successful due to the fast and efficient neutralization of added pro-oxidant TBH. The commercial availability of turmeric and ginger and their frequent combined use in diet suggest ideas for further broader utilization of the beneficial synergistic effect of their phenolic components.",0
"During the opioid epidemic, misuse of acetaminophen-opioid products resulted in supratherapeutic acetaminophen ingestions and cases of hepatotoxicity. In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limited the amount of acetaminophen in combination products to 325 mg, and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) changed hydrocodone/acetaminophen from schedule III to schedule II. This study assessed whether these federal mandates were associated with changes in acetaminophen-opioid supratherapeutic ingestions.",1
"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune prothrombotic disease characterized by thrombosis and/or pregnancy complications caused by antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). The history of APS can be traced back to observations made during screening programs for syphilis conducted in the mid-20th century, with identification of patients with the so-called biological false-positive serological reactions for syphilis. Initial observation linking aPL with recurrent miscarriages was first reported more than 40 years ago. Since then, our understanding of the pathogenesis and management of APS has evolved markedly. Although APS is an autoimmune disease, anticoagulation mainly with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) rather than immunomodulation, is the treatment of choice for thrombotic APS. Direct acting oral anticoagulants are inferior to VKAs, especially those with triple-positive APS and arterial thrombosis. Inflammation, complement activation, and thrombosis in the placenta may contribute to pathogenesis of obstetric APS. Heparin, mainly low-molecular-weight heparin, and low-dose aspirin represent the treatments of choice for women with obstetric complications. Increasingly, immunomodulatory agents such as hydroxychloroquine for thrombotic and obstetric APS are being used, especially in patients who are refractory to present standard treatment.",1
"Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are critically engaged in a number of hallmarks of cancer progression, including proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Thus, the inhibition of ENaCs possesses therapeutic potential in cancer. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol with anti-carcinogenic activity, is a potent activator of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which reduces the abundance of ENaCs in the cell membrane by causing the internalization of the β subunit. However, the effect of resveratrol on ENaCs in cancer cells is unknown. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on ENaCs in human colon cancer cells HCT116 and HT29. The influences of resveratrol either alone or together with AMPK inhibitor compound C (CC), and ENaC inhibitor amiloride on cell viability were examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The expression levels of phospho-AMPK Thr<sup>172</sup> and βENaC in cells were determined by immunofluorescence staining, and the expression of apoptotic markers Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Resveratrol was found to activate AMPK in a dose-dependent manner. Both AMPK activation by resveratrol and ENaC inhibition by amiloride decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis significantly. AMPK activation also reduced βENaC expression in cells. Our results suggest that ENaC inhibition through AMPK activation might be a potential mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effects of resveratrol.",0
"Studies assessing associations between prenatal exposure to antidepressants, maternal depression, and offspring DNA methylation (DNAm) have been inconsistent. Here, we investigated whether prenatal exposure to citalopram or escitalopram ((es)citalopram) and maternal depression is associated with differences in DNAm. Then, we examined if there is an interaction effect of (es)citalopram exposure and DNAm on offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes. Finally, we investigated whether DNAm at birth correlates with neurodevelopmental trajectories in childhood. We analyzed DNAm in cord blood from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) biobank. MoBa contains questionnaire data on maternal (es)citalopram use and depression during pregnancy and information about child neurodevelopmental outcomes assessed by internationally recognized psychometric tests. In addition, we retrieved ADHD diagnoses from the Norwegian Patient Registry and information on pregnancies from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. In total, 958 newborn cord blood samples were divided into three groups: (1) prenatal (es)citalopram exposed (n = 306), (2) prenatal maternal depression exposed (n = 308), and (3) propensity score-selected controls (n = 344). Among children exposed to (es)citalopram, there were more ADHD diagnoses and symptoms and delayed communication and psychomotor development. We did not identify differential DNAm associated with (es)citalopram or depression, nor any interaction effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes throughout childhood. Trajectory modeling identified subgroups of children following similar developmental patterns. Some of these subgroups were enriched for children exposed to maternal depression, and some subgroups were associated with differences in DNAm at birth. Interestingly, several of the differentially methylated genes are involved in neuronal processes and development. These results suggest DNAm as a potential predictive molecular marker of later abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes, but we cannot conclude whether DNAm links prenatal (es)citalopram exposure or maternal depression with child neurodevelopmental outcomes.",1
"Antibacterial electrotherapy is currently activated by external electric field or self-powered generators, but usually needs complicated power management circuits. Herein, near-infrared illumination (NIR) of pyroelectric nanoparticles (NPs) produces a built-in electric field to address the effectiveness and safety concerns in the antibacterial treatment. Janus tBT@PDA NPs were obtained by capping polydopamine (PDA) on tetragonal BaTiO<sub>3</sub> (tBT) NPs through defining the polymerization time, followed by ciprofloxacin (CIP) loading on the PDA caps to fabricate Janus tBT@PDA-Cip NPs. NIR illumination of PDA caps creates temperature variations on tBT NPs to generate photothermal and pyroelectric effects. Finite element simulation reveals a pyroelectric potential of over 1 V and sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced to exhibit pyroelectric dynamic therapy (PEDT). The elevated temperature on one side of the Janus NPs produces thermophoretic force to drive NP motion, which enhances interactions with bacteria and overcomes limitations in the short action distance and lifespan of ROS. The pyroelectric field accelerates CIP release through weakening the π-π stacking and electrostatic interaction with PDA and also interrupts membrane potentials of bacteria to enhance CIP invasion into bacteria. The synergistic antibacterial effect of pyroelectric tBT@PDA-Cip NPs causes the fully recovery of S. aureus-infected skin wounds and regeneration of intact epidermis, blood vessels and hair follicles, while no obvious pathological change or inflammatory lesion is detected in the major organs. Thus, the pyroelectric Janus nanomotors demonstrate synergistic PEDT/photothermal/antibiotic effects to enhance antibacterial efficacy while avoiding the necessity of excessive heat, ROS and antibiotic doses. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Antibacterial treatment is challenged by antibiotics-derived side effects and the evolution of resistant strains. Phototherapy is commonly associated with excessive heat and oxidative stress, and their combinations with other agents are especially encouraged to strengthen antibacterial efficacy while alleviating the associated side effects. Electric field is another activator to generate antibacterial abilities, but usually requires complicated power management and bulk electrodes, making it inconvenient in a biological setup. To address these challenges, we propose a strategy to generate microelectric field on nanoparticles themselves and achieve synergistic electrodynamic-photothermal-antibiotic therapies. The pyroelectric effect weakens interactions between nanoparticles and antibiotics to accelerate drug release, and the built-in pyroelectric field increases membrane fluidity to enhance bacterial uptake of antibiotics.",0
Guidelines recommend respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy as first-line options for hospitalized adults with mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Efficacy of these regimens has not been adequately evaluated.,1
"Real-world evidence (RWE) plays an important role in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). It provides data about the effectiveness and safety of an intervention from outside the randomised controlled trial (RCT) setting and allows healthcare professionals (HCPs) to determine if RCT data are applicable to their patients in routine clinical practice. This review provides a discussion of the value of RWE in T2D management in day-to-day clinical practice, with a focus on RWE with sulfonylureas (SUs), and presents two examples of a new generation of international real-world studies in people with T2D managed in routine clinical practice. RWE plays a valuable role in advising HCPs in the day-to-day management of T2D, informing regulatory authorities with regard to pharmacovigilance and post-approval updates, and providing insights with regard to patients' treatment adherence and preference. RWE should be used alongside RCTs to increase HCP awareness and understanding of their patients' perspectives, potentially allowing for improvements in treatment adherence, glycaemic control and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In addition, real-world studies must be conducted in a way that generates robust RWE by limiting the risks of bias and confounding as much as possible. A growing body of RWE is emerging from Asia. For example, in a preliminary HRQoL analysis of the Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Register, Asian people with T2D had better HRQoL with gliclazide-based treatment than with other SU agents, despite being older and having more diabetes-related complications.",1

"Cancer continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide, making the development of new treatment methods crucial in the fight against it. With cancer incidence rates increasing worldwide, ongoing research must focus on identifying new and effective ways to prevent and treat the disease. The combination of herbal extracts with chemotherapeutic agents has gained much interest as a novel strategy to combat cancer. Rumex obtusifolius L. is a wild plant known for its medicinal properties and is widely distributed worldwide. Our preclinical evaluations suggested that R. obtusifolius seed extracts possessed cancer-inhibiting properties and we also evaluated the beneficial effects of the arginase inhibitor NG-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine and nitric oxide inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester in the treatment of breast cancer. The current study aimed to combine these observations and evaluate the antioxidant and antitumor properties of R. obtusifolius extracts alone and in combination with the arginase and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. Metabolic characterization of the plant extract using a liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry advanced system revealed the presence of 240 phenolic compounds many of which possess anticancer properties, according to the literature. In vitro studies revealed a significant cytotoxic effect of the R. obtusifolius extracts on the human colon (HT29) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. Thus, a new treatment approach of combining R. obtusifolius bioactive phytochemicals with the arginase and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and/or NG-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine, respectively, was proposed and could potentially be an effective way to treat breast cancer. Indeed, these combinations showed immunostimulatory, antiproliferative, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiangiogenic properties in a rat breast cancer model.",0

Diltiazem is a commonly used medication in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with potential for a drug-drug interaction (DDI) with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). We aimed to assess the risk of major bleeding after co-prescription of diltiazem and DOACs among adults with AF.,1
"This study aimed to investigate the possible drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of 5-FU with antihypertensives metabolised by CYP3A4 and 2C9, using blood pressure (BP) as a pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter. Patients who received 5-FU in combination with antihypertensives metabolised by CYP3A4 or 2C9, specifically, a) amlodipine, nifedipine, or amlodipine + nifedipine, b) candesartan or valsartan, or c) amlodipine + candesartan, amlodipine + losartan, or nifedipine + valsartan, (Group A, <i>n</i> = 20) were identified. Patients who received 5-FU with WF and antihypertensives, specifically, a) amlodipine or b) amlodipine + telmisartan, amlodipine + candesartan, or amlodipine + valsartan, (Group B, <i>n</i> = 5) or 5-FU alone (Group C, <i>n</i> = 25) were also identified and analysed as a comparator and control group, respectively. Regarding the peak BP levels during chemotherapy, there was a significant increase in both SBP (<i>P</i> < 0.0002 and 0.0013) and DBP (<i>P</i> = 0.0243 and 0.0032) in Groups A and C, respectively (Tukey-Kramer test). In contrast, although SBP also increased in Group B during chemotherapy, the change was not statistically significant and there was a decrease in DBP. The significant increase in SBP can be attributed to chemotherapy-induced hypertension by 5-FU or other drugs in the chemotherapeutic regimens. However, when comparing the lowest BP levels during chemotherapy, there was a decrease in SBP and DBP in all groups from the baseline values. The median time to peak and lowest BP was at least 2 weeks and 3 weeks, respectively, for all groups, suggesting that a BP lowering effect was observed following the offset of the initial chemotherapy-induced hypertension. At least 1 month after 5-FU chemotherapy, the SBP and DBP returned to baseline values in all groups. Since Group B also showed a significant increase in PT-INR, possibly demonstrating 5-FU inhibition of CYP activity and, consequently, of WF metabolism, it is likely that 5-FU also inhibited the metabolism of the antihypertensive drugs.

"The present work aimed to evaluate different Liquid Crystal Mesophases (LCM) as transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) for nifedipine (NFD), a lipophilic drug model. The formulations composed of water, Citrus sinensis essential oil (CSEO), PPG-5-CETETH-20, and Olive oil ester PEG-7 were obtained and characterized by polarized light microscopy (PLM), rheology, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), Fourier transform infrared coupled with an attenuated total reflection accessory (FTIR-ATR) and in vitro assays: bioadhesion, drug release, skin permeation, and retention tests. As a result, changes in component proportions led to several transparent viscous systems with an anisotropic profile. PLM and SAXS proved the presence of lamellar (S1), hexagonal (S3), and lamellar + hexagonal (S2) LCM, and rheology showed a high viscoelasticity profile. LCMs were able to adhere to the skin, and S2 achieved higher adhesion strength. NFD (5 mg/mL) has not modified the organization of LCMs. Results also showed that S3 promoted higher permeation and retention and higher disorganization of stratum corneum lipids, which is the main permeation-enhancing mechanism. Thus, the formulations obtained can carry and improve drug delivery through the skin and are promising TDDS for lipophilic drug administration, such as NFD.",0
"A low-cost, stable and non-precious metal catalyst for efficient degradation of tetracycline (TC), one of the most widely used antibiotics, has been developed. We report the facile fabrication of an electrolysis-assisted nano zerovalent iron system (E-NZVI) that achieved TC removal efficiency of 97.3% with the initial concentration of 30 mg L<sup>-1</sup> at an applied voltage of 4 V, which was 6.3 times higher than the NZVI system without an applied voltage. The improvement caused by electrolysis was mainly attributed to the stimulation of corrosion of NZVI, which accelerated the release of Fe<sup>2+</sup>. And Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the E-NZVI system could receive electrons to reduce to Fe<sup>2+</sup>, which facilitated the conversion of ineffective ions to effective ions with reducing ability. Moreover, electrolysis assisted to expand the pH range of the E-NZVI system for TC removal. The uniformly dispersed NZVI in the electrolyte facilitated the collection and secondary contamination could be prevented with the easy recycling and regeneration of the spent catalyst. In addition, scavenger experiments revealed that the reducing ability of NZVI was accelerated in the presence of electrolysis, rather than oxidation. TEM-EDS mapping, XRD and XPS analyses indicated that electrolytic effects could also delay the passivation of NZVI after a long run. This is mainly due to the increased electromigration, implying that the corrosion products of iron (iron hydroxides and oxides) are not formed mainly near or on the surface of NZVI. The electrolysis-assisted NZVI shows excellent removal efficiency of TC and is a potential water treatment method for the degradation of antibiotic contaminants.",0
"COVID-19 exhibits diverse and systemic clinical symptoms, much like systemic autoimmune diseases, and there are notable similarities in the immune responses seen in both conditions. There are rare reports of ulcerative colitis and autoimmune hepatitis triggered by COVID-19 infection. Reported herein is a case of a previously healthy patient who was diagnosed with chronic colitis resembling ulcerative colitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, and suspected immune-mediated hepatitis (AIH-like hepatitis) 2 months after a COVID-19 infection. A 33-year-old COVID-19-vaccinated male, presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 2 days. He also had bloody diarrhea that persisted for 2 months after recovering from a COVID-19 infection. A diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was confirmed by markedly elevated serum amylase and lipase and a CT scan of the abdomen. Colonoscopy and histopathology findings also confirmed a diagnosis of chronic colitis resembling ulcerative colitis (Mayo Endoscopy Subscore 3). Marked improvement in bloody diarrhea was observed within 72 h of treatment with IV prednisolone. MRI of the abdomen performed due to an unresolved clinical picture of pancreatitis revealed a bulky pancreas showing delayed diffuse homogenous enhancement, findings possibly consistent with autoimmune pancreatitis. Investigation for elevated liver transaminases showed high titers of antinuclear antibodies and anti-smooth muscle (anti-actin) antibodies while viral hepatitis markers were negative. The patient had already been started on steroid therapy before the lab results were available, with rapid normalization of liver enzymes following treatment. A liver biopsy was not performed. The patient is currently on mesalazine 4 gr/day, and azathioprine 100 mg/day - oral steroids had been tapered and discontinued. Seven months after the initial diagnosis, the patient remains symptom-free. A high level of suspicion for autoimmune disorders is required when assessing patients with a history of COVID-19 infection, although diagnostic pathways remain the same, with generally good response and remission rates to conventional treatment.",0
"Mesenteric ischemia has remained without effective pharmacological management for many years. Sumatriptan, an abortive medication for migraine and cluster headaches, has potent anti-inflammatory properties and ameliorated organ ischemia in previous animal studies. Similarly, inhibition of the kynurenine pathway ameliorated renal and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in many preclinical studies. Herein, we assessed the effect of sumatriptan on experimental mesenteric I/R and investigated whether kynurenine pathway inhibition is a mechanism underlying its action.",0

"Total parental nutrition (TPN) is a critical component of neonatal intensive care. Supply shortages leading to deficiencies in TPN constituents can have devastating consequences for critically ill patients in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), who may be initially misdiagnosed as potential inborn errors of metabolism. Here, we present three cases of patients with prolonged TPN dependence due to intra-abdominal pathology who presented with signs and symptoms concerning for metabolic disorders and who were ultimately determined to be a result of vitamin deficiencies in the TPN after unnecessary testing and interventions had occurred. These diagnostic errors highlight the need for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for nutritional deficiencies when treating patients in the NICU with potential metabolic disorders during times when TPN constituents are not available, as well as advocating to ensure that adequate supplies are maintained for this vulnerable population.",0

"Cytochrome <i>c</i> (Cyt <i>c</i>), a multifunctional protein with a crucial role in controlling cell fate, has been implicated in the amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the interaction between Cyt <i>c</i> and amyloid-β (Aβ) with the consequent impact on the aggregation and toxicity of Aβ is not known. Here we report that Cyt <i>c</i> can directly bind to Aβ and alter the aggregation and toxicity profiles of Aβ in a manner that is dependent on the presence of a peroxide. When combined with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), Cyt <i>c</i> redirects Aβ peptides into less toxic, off-pathway amorphous aggregates, whereas without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, it promotes Aβ fibrillization. The mechanisms behind these effects may involve a combination of the complexation between Cyt <i>c</i> and Aβ, the oxidation of Aβ by Cyt <i>c</i> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and the modification of Cyt <i>c</i> by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Our findings demonstrate a new function of Cyt <i>c</i> as a modulator against Aβ amyloidogenesis.",0
"Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant widely used for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain.

"The cyanobacterial protein PipY belongs to the Pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP)-binding proteins (PLPBP/COG0325) family of pyridoxal-phosphate-binding proteins, which are represented in all three domains of life. These proteins share a high degree of sequence conservation, appear to have purely regulatory functions, and are involved in the homeostasis of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> vitamers and amino/keto acids. Intriguingly, the genomic context of the <i>pipY</i> gene in cyanobacteria connects PipY with PipX, a protein involved in signaling the intracellular energy status and carbon-to-nitrogen balance. PipX regulates its cellular targets <i>via</i> protein-protein interactions. These targets include the PII signaling protein, the ribosome assembly GTPase EngA, and the transcriptional regulators NtcA and PlmA. PipX is thus involved in the transmission of multiple signals that are relevant for metabolic homeostasis and stress responses in cyanobacteria, but the exact function of PipY is still elusive. Preliminary data indicated that PipY might also be involved in signaling pathways related to the stringent stress response, a pathway that can be induced in the unicellular cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942 by overexpression of the (p)ppGpp synthase, RelQ. To get insights into the cellular functions of PipY, we performed a comparative study of PipX, PipY, or RelQ overexpression in <i>S. elongatus</i> PCC7942. Overexpression of PipY or RelQ caused similar phenotypic responses, such as growth arrest, loss of photosynthetic activity and viability, increased cell size, and accumulation of large polyphosphate granules. In contrast, PipX overexpression decreased cell length, indicating that PipX and PipY play antagonistic roles on cell elongation or cell division. Since ppGpp levels were not induced by overexpression of PipY or PipX, it is apparent that the production of polyphosphate in cyanobacteria does not require induction of the stringent response.",0
"As a common flavonols, kaempferol (Kae) has a broad market as health food and medicine for its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, and anti-cancer properties. In this study, a novel convenient and simple fluorescent sensor based on carbon dots (CDs) for the detection of Kae was developed. The fluorescent CDs, with excellent photo-luminescence (PL) and up-conversion luminescence (UCPL) properties, were successfully prepared by low-temperature oil bath reaction based on ascorbic acid as carbon source at 90 °C in one pot. Under the optimal conditions, the fluorescence (FL) intensity of CDs was gradually quenched by the increasing addition of Kae with a linear relationship between F<sub>0</sub>/F and Kae concentration in a wide range from 5 µM to 100 µM with a detection limit of 0.38 µM. And this designed sensor was favourably applied for the detection of Kae in actual sample (xin-da-kang tablets). Moreover, the proposed CDs has great application prospects as a drug-sensor for detecting Kae due to its simple operation, economical and green materials, low equipment requirement, and rapid detection.",0
"The σ<sub>1</sub> receptor (S1R) is a ligand-regulated non-opioid intracellular receptor involved in several pathological conditions. The development of S1R-based drugs as therapeutic agents is a challenge due to the lack of simple functional assays to identify and classify S1R ligands. We have developed a novel nanoluciferase binary technology (NanoBiT) assay based on the ability of S1R to heteromerize with the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) in living cells. The S1R-BiP heterodimerization biosensor allows for rapid and accurate identification of S1R ligands by monitoring the dynamics of association-dissociation of S1R and BiP. Acute treatment of cells with the S1R agonist PRE-084 produced rapid and transient dissociation of the S1R-BiP heterodimer, which was blocked by haloperidol. The effect of PRE-084 was enhanced by calcium depletion, leading to a higher reduction in heterodimerization even in the presence of haloperidol. Prolonged incubation of cells with S1R antagonists (haloperidol, NE-100, BD-1047, and PD-144418) increased the formation of S1R-BiP heteromers, while agonists (PRE-084, 4-IBP, and pentazocine) did not alter heterodimerization under the same experimental conditions. The newly developed S1R-BiP biosensor is a simple and effective tool for exploring S1R pharmacology in an easy cellular setting. This biosensor is suitable for high-throughput applications and a valuable resource in the researcher's toolkit.",0

"The unsatisfactory catalytic activity of nanozymes owing to their inefficient electron transfer (ET) is the major challenge in biomimetic catalysis-related biomedical applications. Inspired by the photoelectron transfers in natural photoenzymes, we herein report a photonanozyme of single-atom Ru anchored on metal-organic frameworks (UiO-67-Ru) for achieving photoenhanced peroxidase (POD)-like activity. We demonstrate that the atomically dispersed Ru sites can realize high photoelectric conversion efficiency, superior POD-like activity (7.0-fold photoactivity enhancement relative to that of UiO-67), and good catalytic specificity. Both in situ experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that photoelectrons follow the cofactor-mediated ET process of enzymes to promote the production of active intermediates and the release of products, demonstrating more favorable thermodynamics and kinetics in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reduction. Taking advantage of the unique interaction of the Zr-O-P bond, we establish a UiO-67-Ru-based immunoassay platform for the photoenhanced detection of organophosphorus pesticides.",0
"Homogeneously dispersed copper nanowire (CuNW) materials are the basis for practical applications in many types of electronic devices. At present, the dispersion of CuNWs in water is achieved through polymeric spatial site resistance effects primarily and the electrostatic dispersion mechanism in a few. However, the electrical conductivity of CuNWs could be weakened by the excessive addition of polymers; therefore, it is difficult to maintain a stable dispersion enduringly for surface charge modifiers. Based on the coagulation mechanism of colloids, a novel antisedimentation mechanism is refined by this work. Directed by this mechanism, a stable reciprocal-supporting antisedimentation conductive CuNW ink was achieved enduringly and a uniform conductive coating (1.81-5.65 Ω·sq<sup>-1</sup>) was successfully manufactured. The tannic acid-polyethylene imine (TA-PEI) could support copper nanowires to maintain a stable height of 61.4% after 15 days best, while CuNWs in other systems would settle completely in one day. Meanwhile, the TA-PEI composite cluster antisedimentation network not only provided massive spatial potential resistance for CuNWs but also modified the surface charge of CuNWs. CuNWs were dispersed stably in this phenol-amine@CuNW network. Furthermore, the CuNWs were crosslinked more tightly with each other relying on the vigorous adhesive properties of TA-PEI. With this antisedimentation mechanism and simple treatment process, CuNW ink will be utilized in more applications.",0

"The abuse of benzodiazepines is a serious health hazard that can cause damage to the central nervous system.Trace monitoring of benzodiazepines in serum can effectively prevent the damage caused by these drugs. Therefore, in this study, a Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@PDA@Au core-shell satellite nanomaterial SERS(Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering) probe that integrates magnetic separation techniques and a multi-hotspot structure was synthetized by in situ growth of gold nanoparticles on the surface of PDA(Polymerized dopamine)-coated Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The size and gap of Au nanoparticles on the surface of the SERS probe can be modulated by regulating the amount of HAuCl<sub>4</sub> to create 3D multi-hotspot structures. The good dispersion and superparamagnetic properties of this SERS probe enable it to fully contact and load the target molecules in the serum, and the applied magnetic field facilitates separation and enrichment.This process increases the molecular density and number of SERS hotspots, thereby enhancing detection sensitivity. Based on the above considerations, this SERS probe can detect traces of eszopiclone and diazepam in serum at concentrations as low as 1 μg/ml with good linearity, offering promising applications in clinical monitoring of drug concentrations in blood.",0
"Hyperuricemia relates to chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and impaired endothelial function. Febuxostat is potent and effective for decreasing serum uric acid levels. Information for the effect of febuxostat treatment on markers of endothelial dysfunction and renal injury among patients with CKD remains limited. A total of 84 patients with CKD stages III-IV with asymptomatic hyperuricemia were randomly assigned to either the febuxostat (40 mg/day, N = 42) or the matching control (N = 42) group for 8 weeks. Serum asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine albumin, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), ankle brachial index (ABI) and serum uric acid were measured at baseline and at the end of study. Febuxostat administration significantly reduced the serum uric acid concentration among patients with CKD when compared with control [- 3.40 (95% CI - 4.19 to - 2.62) vs. - 0.35 (95% CI - 0.76 to 0.06) mg/dL; P < 0.001, respectively). No significant difference in the changes in serum ADMA, hs-CRP, eGFR and albuminuria was identified between the two groups. Subgroup analysis among patients with decreased serum uric acid after febuxostat, the estimated GFR change between the febuxostat and the control group showed significant difference at 8 weeks (2.01 (95% CI 0.31 to 3.7) vs. 0.04 (95% CI - 1.52 to 1.61) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; P = 0.030, respectively). Adverse events specific to febuxostat were not observed. Febuxostat effectively reduced serum uric acid in the CKD population without improving endothelial dysfunction. It was able to preserve renal function in the subgroup of patients with CKD and lower serum uric acid level after treatment.Trial registration: Thai Clinical Trials, TCTR20210224005: 24/022021 http://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20210224005 .",1
"A woman in her 40s was transferred to the medical intensive care unit due to severe COVID-19 infection causing respiratory failure. Her respiratory failure worsened rapidly, requiring intubation and continuous sedation with fentanyl and propofol infusions. She required progressive increases in the rates of the propofol infusion, as well as addition of midazolam and cisatracurium due to ventilator dyssynchrony. To support the high sedative doses, norepinephrine was administered as a continuous infusion. She developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, with rates ranging between 180 and 200 s which did not respond to intravenous adenosine, metoprolol, synchronised cardioversion or amiodarone. A blood draw revealed lipaemia, and triglyceride levels were noted to be elevated to 2018. The patient developed high-grade fevers up to 105.3 and acute renal failure with severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, indicating propofol-related infusion syndrome. Propofol was promptly discontinued. An insulin-dextrose infusion was initiated which improved patient's fevers and hypertriglyceridaemia.",1
"The peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation mechanism is closely related to the structure/configuration of the ""active site"" of the Fenton-like catalysts. In this paper, it is shown that Cu<sup>2+</sup> chemically bonds the surface of birnessite at the Mn vacancy site to form triple-corner-sharing inner-sphere surface complexes (Cu-Bir), which regulates the PMS activation mechanism. Birnessite/PMS Fenton-like system degrades phenol via a non-radical mechanism, which involves high valent Mn(V)=O generated from the surface reaction of Mn(III) with adsorbed PMS. While Cu-Bir initiates an additional radical mechanism that involves reactive oxygen species of ⋅O<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup> and <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> , and the k value of 5Cu-Bir is 1.9 times higher than that of Bir. The Fenton-like reaction mechanism of the Cu-Bir/PMS system is thus proposed as a radical and non-radical cooccurrence mechanism, which involves a synergistic effect that the radical pathway accelerates the regeneration of Mn(III) for the non-radical pathway, and the non-radical pathway assists to produce <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> for the radical pathway.",0
"Nonsteroidal antiinf lammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain the mainstay of the pharmacologic management for relieving osteoarthritis pain, and low-dose aspirin is often prescribed to osteoarthritis patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We conducted cohort studies using data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (2000-2019) to assess whether the relationship of initiation of naproxen or ibuprofen vs. initiation of other NSAIDs (excluding both naproxen and ibuprofen), respectively, to the risk of CVD was modified by coprescription of low-dose aspirin among the participants with osteoarthritis. Among participants without coprescription of aspirin, the risk of CVD was lower in naproxen initiators (10.3/1000 person-years) than in other NSAIDs initiators (13.2/1000 person-years; hazard ratio = 0.71, 95% confidence interval: 0.60, 0.85). Among participants with coprescription of aspirin, however, the risk of CVD was higher among naproxen initiators (36.9/1000 person-years) than that among other NSAIDs initiators (34.8/1000 person-years; hazard ratio = 1.48, 95% confidence interval: 1.12, 1.84). The association was significantly modified by coprescription of aspirin (P < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in the association of initiation of ibuprofen vs. other NSAIDs with the risk of CVD, which was significantly modified by coprescription of aspirin (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that osteoarthritis patients and clinicians should be aware of the potential CVD risk of concurrently taking naproxen or ibuprofen and low-dose aspirin.",1

"Aims To study sex differences in major bleeding in relation to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods and results The Collective Cardiology Research registry was designed to evaluate the application and outcomes of DAPT after ACS/PCI in the Rijnmond region in the Netherlands. Overall, 1172 women (median age 67.5 years) and 3087 men (62.2 years) with ACS/PCI were enrolled between August 2011 and June 2013. Based on a tailored regional DAPT guideline aiming at bleeding risk minimization, 52.6% women and 66.9% men received prasugrel as first-choice P2Y12 inhibitor, additional to aspirin. Women more frequently had contraindications for the use of prasugrel (and therefore received clopidogrel) than men (47.9 vs. 26.9%, p<0.001). Femoral access was more common in women than in men (47.6 vs. 38.1%, p<0.001). Women had higher incidence of TIMI major bleeding at 1 year than men (2.6 vs. 1.6%, p=0.018). After adjustment for established bleeding risk factors, female sex was associated with over two-fold higher risk of TIMI major bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 4.32). This difference was already apparent at discharge, and appeared to be caused by access site bleedings (0.9 vs. 0.1%, p<0.001). No sex differences were found in non-access site related TIMI major bleeding up to 1 year. Conclusion Women with ACS/PCI receiving DAPT had higher TIMI major bleeding risk caused by an excess in access-site bleeds, mainly in relation to the femoral approach.",1
"Advances have been made in recent years in using opioid receptor antagonists as an adjunct therapy to psychotropic medication to reduce debilitating weight gain and metabolic adverse effects associated with in particular second generation antipsychotics. However, it is unknown whether second generation antipsychotics produce a change in opioid receptor expression in the brain. The present study investigated early changes in opioid receptor expression in the female rat hypothalamus, a master controller of hunger and metabolic regulation, after acute treatment with olanzapine, a commonly used second generation antipsychotic. Using quantitative spatial in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography, expression levels of the three opioid receptors; kappa, mu and delta, were determined at mRNA and protein level, respectively, in the five hypothalamic areas: paraventricular nucleus, arcuate nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and lateral hypothalamus. After 48 h of olanzapine treatment at clinically relevant plasma concentration weight gain and food intake changes, and increased plasma glucose were observed in female rats. Olanzapine treatment also led to a significant increase in mu opioid receptor availability in the arcuate nucleus, which contains both satiety and hunger controlling neurons. No other areas showed any opioid receptor expressional changes with olanzapine treatment on neither at mRNA nor protein level. Technical difficulties made it impossible to analyze mRNA levels in the lateral hypothalamus and overall binding of delta opioid receptors. Thus, the present study provided insights in to how olanzapine at clinically relevant plasma levels already at an early stage modulated the opioid system in the hypothalamus.",1
"Microalgae represent a growing innovative source of nutraceuticals such as carotenoids and phenolic compound which are naturally present within these single-celled organisms or can be induced in response to specific growth conditions. The presence of the unfavourable allelic variant in genes involved in the control of oxidative stress, due to one or more SNPs in gene encoding protein involved in the regulation of redox balance, can lead to pathological conditions such as insulin resistance, which, in turn, is directly involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

"Transient receptor potential canonical type 6 (TRPC6) is a non-voltage-gated channel that principally conducts calcium. Elevated channel activation contributes to fibrosis, hypertrophy, and proteinuria, often coupled to stimulation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). TRPC6 is post-translationally regulated, but a role for O-linked β-N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) as elevated by diabetes, is unknown. Here we show TRPC6 is constitutively O-GlcNAcylated at Ser14, Thr70, and Thr221 in the N-terminus ankryn-4 (AR4) and linker (LH1) domains. Mutagenesis to alanine reveals T221 as a critical controller of resting TRPC6 conductance, and associated NFAT activity and pro-hypertrophic signaling. T→A mutations at sites homologous in closely related TRPC3 and TRPC7 also increases their activity. Molecular modeling predicts interactions between Thr221-<i>O</i>-GlcNAc and Ser199, Glu200, and Glu246, and combined alanine substitutions of the latter similarly elevates resting NFAT activity. Thus, O-GlcNAcylated T221 and interactions with coordinating residues is required for normal TRPC6 channel conductance and NFAT activation.",0
"<b>Aim:</b> To investigate potential pharmacokinetic interactions between atogepant and esomeprazole. <b>Methods:</b> Atogepant, esomeprazole, or both were administered to 32 healthy adults in an open-label, nonrandomized, crossover study.

"A new enantioselective open-tubular capillary electrochromatography was developed employing poly(glycidyl methacrylate) nanoparticles/β-cyclodextrin covalent organic frameworks chemically immobilized on the inner wall of the capillary as a stationary phase. A pretreated silica-fused capillary reacted with 3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane followed by poly(glycidyl methacrylate) nanoparticles and β-cyclodextrin covalent organic frameworks through a ring-opening reaction. The resulting coating layer on the capillary was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The electroosmotic flow was studied to evaluate the variation of the immobilized columns. The chiral separation performance of the fabricated capillary columns was validated by the analysis of the four racemic proton pump inhibitors including lansoprazole, pantoprazole, tenatoprazole, and omeprazole. The influences of bonding concentration, bonding time, bonding temperature, buffer type and concentration, buffer pH, and applied voltage on the enantioseparation of four proton pump inhibitors were investigated. Good enantioseparation efficiencies were achieved for all enantiomers. In the optimum conditions, the enantiomers of four proton pump inhibitors were fully resolved within 10 min with high resolutions of 9.5-13.9. The column-to-column and inter- to intra-day repeatability of the fabricated capillary columns through relative standard deviation were found better than 9.54%, exhibiting satisfactory stability and repeatability of the fabricated capillary columns.",0
"Electro-Fenton (e-Fenton) is a promising method for wastewater treatment that relies on powerful ·OH generated via the decomposition of electro-generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> catalyzed by Fe<sup>2+</sup>. In this regard, developing a catalyst capable of simultaneously producing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and accelerating Fe<sup>2+</sup> regeneration is of considerable importance; however, this remains a challenge because of the difficulty in modulating the electronic microenvironment. Herein, a hollow porous carbon sphere catalyst (HPCS) is developed to synchronously enhance H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation and accelerate Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> cycling by constructing an electron-rich microenvironment via surface curvature regulation. The Fe<sup>2+</sup> regeneration efficiency reaches 35.5% on HPCS featuring a larger curvature structure (HPCS-TPOS), which is 1.6 times higher than the smaller curvature HPCS-S catalyst (22.8%). Density functional theory reveals that the electron-rich microenvironment on the outer surface of high curvature structure promotes Fe<sup>2+</sup> regeneration. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rate on HPCS-TPOS is 47.2 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, exceeding the state-of-the-art e-Fenton catalysts reported. Benefiting from the concurrent high-efficiency of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and Fe<sup>2+</sup> regeneration, HPCS-TPOS e-Fenton is demonstrated to be efficient for sulfamethoxazole removal with the kinetic rate of 0.30-0.72 min<sup>-1</sup> at pH 3-7. This work offers new insight into the design of efficient catalysts by rationally regulating curvature structures for wastewater treatment.",0
"Data on the distribution of voriconazole (VRC) in the human peritoneal cavity are sparse. This prospective study aimed to describe the pharmacokinetics of intravenous VRC in the peritoneal fluid of critically ill patients. A total of 19 patients were included. Individual pharmacokinetic curves, drawn after single (first dose on day 1) and multiple (steady-state) doses, displayed a slower rise and lower fluctuation of VRC concentrations in peritoneal fluid than in plasma. Good but variable penetration of VRC into the peritoneal cavity was observed, and the median (range) peritoneal fluid/plasma ratios of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were 0.54 (0.34 to 0.73) and 0.67 (0.63 to 0.94) for single and multiple doses, respectively. Approximately 81% (13/16) of the VRC steady-state trough concentrations (<i>C</i><sub>min,ss</sub>) in plasma were within the therapeutic range (1 to 5.5 μg/mL), and the corresponding <i>C</i><sub>min,ss</sub> (median [range]) in peritoneal fluid was 2.12 (1.39 to 3.72) μg/mL. Based on the recent 3-year (2019 to 2021) surveillance of the antifungal susceptibilities for <i>Candida</i> species isolated from peritoneal fluid in our center, the aforementioned 13 <i>C</i><sub>min,ss</sub> in peritoneal fluid exceeded the MIC<sub>90</sub> of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis (0.06, 1.00, and 0.25 μg/mL, respectively), which supported VRC as a reasonable choice for initial empirical therapies against intraabdominal candidiasis caused by these three <i>Candida</i> species, prior to the receipt of susceptibility testing results.",0
"Tetracycline resistance in streptococci is mainly due to ribosomal protection mediated by the <i>tet</i>(M) gene that is usually located in the integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) of the Tn<i>916</i>-family. In this study, we analyzed the genes involved in tetracycline resistance and the associated mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in <i>Streptococcus dysgalactiae</i> subsp. <i>equisimilis</i> (SDSE) causing invasive disease. SDSE resistant to tetracycline collected from 2012 to 2019 in a single hospital and from 2018 in three other hospitals were analyzed by whole genome sequencing. Out of a total of 84 SDSE isolates, 24 (28.5%) were resistant to tetracycline due to the presence of <i>tet</i>(M) (<i>n</i> = 22), <i>tet</i>(W) (<i>n</i> = 1), or <i>tet</i>(L) plus <i>tet</i>(W) (<i>n</i> = 1). The <i>tet</i>(M) genes were found in the ICEs of the Tn<i>916</i>-family (<i>n</i> = 10) and in a new integrative and mobilizable element (IME; <i>n</i> = 12). Phylogenetic analysis showed a higher genetic diversity among the strains carrying Tn<i>916</i> than those having the new IME, which were closely related, and all belonged to CC15. In conclusion, tetracycline resistance in SDSE is mostly due to the <i>tet</i>(M) gene associated with ICEs belonging to the Tn<i>916</i>-family and a new IME. This new IME is a major cause of tetracycline resistance in invasive <i>Streptococcus dysgalactiae</i> subsp. <i>equisimilis</i> in our settings.",0
"Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a class of antibiotics with emerging concern. This study investigated the photochemical properties of two representative FQs, i.e., norfloxacin (NORF) and ofloxacin (OFLO). Results showed that both FQs could sensitize the photo-transformation of acetaminophen under UV-A irradiation, during which excited triplet state (<sup>3</sup>FQ*) was the main active species. In the presence of 3 mM Br<sup>‾</sup>, the photolysis rate of acetaminophen increased by 56.3% and 113.5% in the solutions with 10 μM NORF and OFLO, respectively. Such an effect was ascribed to the generation of reactive bromine species (RBS), which was verified by 3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole (DMPZ) probing approach. <sup>3</sup>FQ* reacts with acetaminophen through one-electron transfer, producing radical intermediates which then couple to each other. Presence of Br<sup>‾</sup> did not lead to the formation of brominated products but the same coupling products, which suggests that radical bromine species, rather than free bromine, were responsible for the accelerated acetaminophen transformation. According to the identified reaction products and assisted with the theoretical computation, the transformation pathways of acetaminophen under UV-A irradiation were proposed. The results reported herein suggest that sunlight-driven reactions of FQs and Br<sup>‾</sup> may influence the transformation of coexisting pollutants in surface water environments.",0
"Inflammation is one of the most significant causes of several chronic diseases, which includes the expression of cytokines activating immune cells to up-regulate the inflammatory cascade. Polysaccharides from marine macroalgae are promising anti-inflammatory agents because of their potential to attenuate inflammatory cytokines. The triangular sea bell Turbinaria decurrens (Sargassaceae) among marine macroalgae is ubiquitous in oceanic waters, and a sulfated polygalactofucan SPTd-2 [→3-(α-L-fucp-(2-OSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>)-(1 → 4)-α-L-fucp-(3-OAc)-(1 → 4)-β-D-galp-(1→] was purified from the species. The studied polygalactofucan SPTd-2 exhibited anti-inflammatory activities against cyclooxygenase-2 (IC<sub>50</sub> 10.56 μM) and 5-lipoxygenase (IC<sub>50</sub> 3.36 μM) with a greater selectivity index (2.35) than ibuprofen (0.44), besides attenuating pro-inflammatory cytokine production, including tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-2, 1β, and interferon-γ. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction displayed that SPTd-2 blocked the mRNA of interferon-γ and interleukin-2, in the human monocytic cell line THP-1. The results showed the potential of SPTd-2 to attenuate inflammation-associated disorders.",0

"The KBr pellet press method for detecting the infrared spectrum of coal is one of the commonly used methods for analyzing the types and content of functional groups in coal. However, KBr crystalline water or moisture has a significant impact on the peak position, peak shape, and peak area of the organic O-H based stretching vibration wave in coal. In this paper, the theoretical characteristics of infrared spectra of phenols and alcohols have been simulated and analyzed using the Gaussian 16 series of programs. Four infrared spectral analysis techniques, in situ infrared, KBr pellet press, dry KBr pellet press, and paste methods, have been used to detect the infrared spectra of coal. The results show that the stretching vibration peaks of free O-H radicals without hydrogen bonding are located between 3700 and 3600 cm<sup>-1</sup>. After the O-H form hydrogen bonds with each other, the O-H stretching vibration frequency moves toward the low frequency direction, and the lower the wavenumber, the more O-H content. The conventional KBr gasket manufacturing process will absorb moisture in the air to interfere with the hydroxyl absorption peak of coal, and the experimental process requires absolute drying. The relative content of hydroxyl in coal can be compared and analyzed based on the peak position, peak shape, and peak area of the hydroxyl stretching vibration wave. Quantitative analysis of hydroxyl groups in coal also requires combination of elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.",0
"The objective of this study was to conduct chemical analyses of bioactive compounds found in the bark and leaves of <i>Humiria balsamifera</i> (Aubl.) A. St. Hil. and <i>Hymenaea courbaril</i> L. Chemical screening was performed to detect the presence of secondary metabolites. Quantification of the concentrations of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and antioxidants was performed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry through recommended methodologies. Extracts of the leaves of <i>Humiria balsamifera</i> (Aubl.) A. St. Hil. were found to have high concentrations of flobabénic tannins. Tannins, flavonoids, flavonols, flavonones, flavanonols, xanthones, steroids, and saponins were also found in bark extracts of the same species. The plant species <i>Humiria balsamifera</i> (Aubl.) A. St. Hil. and <i>Hymenaea courbaril</i> L. showed potential for antioxidant activity and for use in the pharmacological and food industries.",0

"Pharmaceuticals can be considered a global threat to aquatic ecosystems due to their pseudo-persistence and their potential toxicity towards non-target species. Amoxicillin (AMX) and carbamazepine (CBZ) and their mixture (1:1) were investigated on the marine copepod Tigriopus fulvus (Fischer, 1860) considering both acute and chronic endpoints. While acute and chronic exposure did not directly affect survival, reproductive endpoints were affected like the mean egg hatching time that was significantly longer than the negative control for treatments with AMX (0.789 ± 0.079 μg/L), CBZ (8.88 ± 0.89 μg/L), and AMX and CMZ as a mixture (1.03 ± 0.10 μg/L and 0.941 ± 0.094 μg/L), in that order.",0
Patients are consecutively screened for contact allergy to corticosteroids with budesonide and tixocortol-21-pivalate in the European baseline series.

"Flavorings used in cookies, electronic cigarettes, popcorn, and breads contain approximately 30 chemical compounds, which makes it difficult to determine and correlate signs and symptoms of acute, subacute or chronic toxicity. The aim of this study was to characterize a butter flavoring chemically and subsequently examine the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> toxicological profile using cellular techniques, invertebrates, and lab mammals. For the first time, the ethyl butanoate was found as the main compound of a butter flavoring (97.75%) and 24 h-toxicity assay employing <i>Artemia salina</i> larvae revealed a linear effect and LC<sub>50</sub> value of 14.7 (13.7-15.7) mg/ml (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9448). Previous reports about higher oral doses of ethyl butanoate were not found. Observational screening with doses between 150-1000 mg/kg by gavage displayed increased amount of defecation, palpebral ptosis, and grip strength reduction, predominantly at higher doses. The flavoring also produced clinical signs of toxicity and diazepam-like behavioral changes in mice, including loss of motor coordination, muscle relaxation, increase of locomotor activity and intestinal motility, and induction of diarrhea, with deaths occurring after 48 h exposure. This substance fits into category 3 of the Globally Harmonized System. Data demonstrated that butter flavoring altered the emotional state in Swiss mice and disrupted intestinal motility, which may be a result of neurochemical changes or direct lesions in the central/peripheral nervous systems.",0
"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) represents a condition in which the normal protective Lactobacilli, especially those that produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, are replaced by high quantities of facultative anaerobes, leading to gynecologic and obstetric post-operative complications. BV is an important cause of obstetric and gynecological adverse sequelae and it could lead to an increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea, genital herpes, <i>Chlamydia</i>, <i>Trichomonas</i>, and human immunodeficiency virus. Herein, we reviewed bacterial vaginosis and its association with post-operative pelvic infections. In Obstetrics, BV has been associated with increased risk of preterm delivery, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing in vitro fertilization, preterm premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, amniotic fluid infections, postpartum and postabortal endomyometritis as well as postabortal pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In gynecology, BV increases the risk of post-hysterectomy infections such as vaginal cuff cellulitis, pelvic cellulitis, pelvic abscess, and PID. BV is often asymptomatic, can resolve spontaneously, and often relapses with or without treatment. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends testing for BV in women having an increased risk for preterm delivery. Women with symptoms should be evaluated and treated. Women with BV undergoing gynecological surgeries must be treated to reduce the frequency of post-operative pelvic infections. Metronidazole and clindamycin are the mainstays of therapy. Currently, there is no consensus on pre-surgery screening for BV; decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.",1

"Direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (DSHP) from H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> offers a promising alternative to the present commercial anthraquinone method, but it still faces the challenges of low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> productivity, low stability of catalysts, and high risk of explosion. Herein, by loading in a microchannel reactor, the as-synthesized Pd-Sn alloy materials exhibit high catalytic activity for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, presenting a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> productivity of 3124 g kg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. The doped Sn atoms on the surface of Pd not only facilitate the release of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> but also effectively slow down the deactivation of catalysts. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Pd-Sn alloy surface has the property of antihydrogen poisoning, showing higher activity and stability than pure Pd catalysts. The deactivation mechanism of the catalyst was elucidated, and the online reactivation method was developed. In addition, we show that the long-life Pd-Sn alloy catalyst can be achieved by supplying an intermittent flow of hydrogen gas. This work provides guidance on how to prepare high performance and stable Pd-Sn alloy catalysts for the continuous and direct synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.",0

"Aripiprazole is recommended for routine use in schizophrenia patients. However, the biological mechanism for the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among schizophrenia patients with the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole is far from clear. To explore the potential genetic factors that may cause movement-related adverse antipsychotic effects in patients, we conducted an association analysis between movement-related ADRs and SNPs in schizophrenia patients receiving aripiprazole monotherapy. In this study, multiple ADRs of 384 patients were quantified within 6-week treatment, and the scores of movement-related ADRs at baseline and follow-up time points during treatment were obtained. The highest score record was used as the quantitative index in analysis, and genetic analysis at the genome-wide level was conducted. The SNP rs4149181 in SLC22A8 [P = 2.28 × 10<sup>-8</sup>] showed genome-wide significance, and rs2284223 in ADCYAP1R1 [P = 9.76 × 10<sup>-8</sup>], rs73258503 in KCNIP4 [P = 1.39 × 10<sup>-7</sup>], rs678428 in SMAD9 [P = 4.70 × 10<sup>-7</sup>], rs6421034 in NAP1L4 [P = 6.80 × 10<sup>-7</sup>], and rs1394796 in ERBB4 [P = 8.60 × 10<sup>-7</sup>] were found to be significantly associated with movement-related ADRs. The combined prediction model of these six loci showed acceptable performance in predicting adverse events [area under the curve (AUC): 0.84]. Combined with the function and network of the above genes and other candidate loci (KCNA1, CACNG1, etc.), we hypothesize that SLC22A8 and KCNIP4-Kv channel perform their respective functions as transporter or channel and participate in the in vivo metabolism or effects of aripiprazole. The above results imply the important function of ion transporters and channels in movement-related adverse antipsychotic effects in aripiprazole monotherapy schizophrenia patients.",1
"Oplopanax elatus is a valuable medicinal plant, but its plant resource is lacking. Adventitious root (AR) culture of O. elatus is an effective way for the production of plant materials. Salicylic acid (SA) exerts enhancement effect on metabolite synthesis in some plant cell/organ culture systems. To clarify the elicitation effect of SA on fed-batch cultured O. elatus ARs, this study investigated the effects of SA concentration, and elicitation time and duration. Results showed that flavonoid and phenolic contents, and antioxidant enzyme activity obviously increased when the fed-batch cultured ARs were treated with 100 μM SA for 4 days starting on day 35. Under this elicitation condition, total flavonoid and phenolic contents reached 387 rutin mg/g DW and 128 gallic acid mg/g DW, respectively, which were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those in the SA-untreated control. In addition, DPPH scavenging and ABTS<sup>+</sup> scavenging rates, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelating rate also greatly increased after SA treatment, and their EC<sub>50</sub> values were 0.0117, 0.61, and 3.34 mg/L, respectively, indicating the high antioxidant activity. The findings of the present study revealed that SA could be used as an elicitor to improve the flavonoid and phenolic production in fed-batch O. elatus AR culture.",0
"Gallic acid (GA) is a phenolic molecule found naturally in a wide range of fruits as well as in medicinal plants. It has many health benefits due to its antioxidant properties. This study focused on finding out the neurobiological effects and mechanisms of GA using published data from reputed databases. For this, data were collected from various sources, such as PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, SpringerLink, and Web of Science. The findings suggest that GA can be used to manage several neurological diseases and disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, strokes, sedation, depression, psychosis, neuropathic pain, anxiety, and memory loss, as well as neuroinflammation. According to database reports and this current literature-based study, GA may be considered one of the potential lead compounds to treat neurological diseases and disorders. More preclinical and clinical studies are required to establish GA as a neuroprotective drug.",0
"Tardive sensory syndrome (TSS) is a subtype of tardive syndrome (TS), and its etiology is still uncertain. Lurasidone is an atypical antipsychotic that has high affinity for dopamine D2- and serotonergic 5HT2A- and 5-HT7-receptors.",1
"Migraine is a debilitating disorder, and while the introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has led to efficacious and tolerable responses, a substantial number of patients are so-called ""non-responders"". We introduce reasons for this insufficient response, including insufficient blockade of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) or its receptor. We present a clinical case, i.e. a female migraine patient who mistakenly administered supratherapeutic (three-fold higher) doses of erenumab leading to more efficacious clinical responses without any side-effects. This example illustrates that the initial dosages might have been too low, resulting in a remaining undesired increased effect of CGRP. While a capsaicin forearm model has repeatedly been used to evaluate the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of mAbs, we provide directions to revisit or reconsider dose-finding and dose-ranging of these drugs. These directions include (i) refinement and application of a capsaicin forehead model (instead of a forearm model) to study trigeminovascular activity and improve dosing, and (ii) reconsideration of trial populations. Indeed, the dose-finding studies were mainly performed in relatively young and normal-weight males, while most phase III/IV trials are marked by a high female-to-male ratio, mainly consisting of overweight to obese females. Considering these aspects in future trials could optimize healthcare for a larger proportion of migraine patients.",1
"Pickering emulsions are promising systems to act as carriers of active hydrophobic components, and to improve compatibility and the water vapor barrier properties of bio-based films. This study aimed to investigated the effects of cinnamon essential oil Pickering emulsions (CEOEs) using zein/carboxymethyl tamarind gum as stabilizers on the mechanical, barrier, antibacterial and antioxidant properties of Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) films, and assessed the influence of carboxymethylation degree. In addition, the effect of the packaging was studied on the shelf life of cherry tomatoes. Results showed that the droplet size reduced approximately from 93.03 to 10.59 μm with the increasing degree of substitution (DS), greatly facilitating the droplet uniform distribution in film matrix. Moreover, with the addition of CEOEs, significant increase was observed with the tensile strength from 8.46 to 25.41 MPa, and the water vapor permeability decreased from 6.18 × 10<sup>-10</sup> to 4.24 × 10<sup>-10</sup> g·m<sup>-1</sup>·s<sup>-1</sup>·Pa<sup>-1</sup>. The films exhibited good UV barrier properties without sacrificing the transparency after adding CEO. Furthermore, the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the prepared films have also been greatly improved. Consequently, the CEOEs was an ideal alternative for incorporation with HPMC based films for increasing the shelf life of cherry tomatoes.",0
"Heart failure (HF) remains one of the most common causes of hospitalization and mortality among Polish patients. The position of the Section of Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy presents the currently applicable options for pharmacological treatment of HF based on the latest European and American guidelines from 2021-2022 in relation to Polish healthcare conditions. Treatment of HF varies depending on its clinical presentation (acute/chronic) or left ventricular ejection fraction. Initial treatment of symptomatic patients with features of volume overload is based on diuretics, especially loop drugs. Treatment aimed at reducing mortality and hospitalization should include drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, preferably angiotensin receptor antagonist/neprilysin inhibitor, i.e. sacubitril/valsartan, selected beta-blockers (no class effect - options include bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate, or vasodilatory beta-blockers - carvedilol and nebivolol), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor (flozin), constituting the 4 pillars of pharmacotherapy. Their effectiveness has been confirmed in numerous prospective randomized trials. The current HF treatment strategy is based on the fastest possible implementation of all four mentioned classes of drugs due to their independent additive action. It is also important to individualize therapy according to comorbidities, blood pressure, resting heart rate, or the presence of arrhythmias. This article emphasizes the cardio- and nephroprotective role of flozins in HF therapy, regardless of ejection fraction value. We propose practical guidelines for the use of medicines, profile of adverse reactions, drug interactions, as well as pharmacoeconomic aspects. The principles of treatment with ivabradine, digoxin, vericiguat, iron supplementation, or antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy are also discussed, along with recent novel drugs including omecamtiv mecarbil, tolvaptan, or coenzyme Q10 as well as progress in the prevention and treatment of hyperkalemia. Based on the latest recommendations, treatment regimens for different types of HF are discussed.",0
"Sporicidal products containing hydrogen peroxide (HP), peracetic acid (PAA), and acetic acid (AA) are used widely in multiple industries, including healthcare.

"A different drug-drug interaction (DDI) scenario may exist in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared with healthy volunteers (HVs), depending on the interplay between drug-drug and disease (drug-drug-disease interaction (DDDI)). Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, in lieu of a clinical trial, is a promising tool for evaluating these complex DDDIs in patients. However, the prediction confidence of PBPK modeling in the severe CKD population is still low when nonrenal pathways are involved. More mechanistic virtual disease population and robust validation cases are needed. To this end, we aimed to: (i) understand the implications of severe CKD on statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin) pharmacokinetics (PK) and DDI; and (ii) predict untested clinical scenarios of statin-roxadustat DDI risks in patients to guide suitable dose regimens. A novel virtual severe CKD population was developed incorporating the disease effect on both renal and nonrenal pathways. Drug and disease PBPK models underwent a four-way validation. The verified PBPK models successfully predicted the altered PKs in patients for substrates and inhibitors and recovered the observed statin-rifampicin DDIs in patients and the statin-roxadustat DDIs in HVs within 1.25- and 2-fold error. Further sensitivity analysis revealed that the severe CKD effect on statins PK is mainly mediated by hepatic BCRP for rosuvastatin and OATP1B1/3 for atorvastatin. The magnitude of statin-roxadustat DDI in patients with severe CKD was predicted to be similar to that in HVs. PBPK-guided suitable dose regimens were identified to minimize the risk of side effects or therapeutic failure of statins when co-administered with roxadustat.",1
"H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) have been used to treat gastritis by inhibiting gastric acid. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more potent acid suppressants than H2RA.

"Aciclovir-induced neurotoxicity results from the accumulation of aciclovir and its metabolite 9-carboxymethoxymethylguanine (CMMG). It occurs predominantly in older patients with impaired renal function and is characterised by a combination of confusion and psychiatric changes. Seizures, myoclonus and dysarthria may also occur. Critically, peritoneal dialysis has little effect on reversing the toxic effects of aciclovir. We describe a woman in her 70s with renal failure who developed confusion and seizures after receiving aciclovir. She was ultimately diagnosed with aciclovir-induced neurotoxicity, confirmed by an elevated serum CMMG concentration. This condition is likely to be underdiagnosed and the neurologist's primary challenge is differentiating aciclovir-induced neurotoxicity from viral encephalitis.",1

This study was designed to investigate the impact of single-nucleotide polymorphism-encoded cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4/5) on clinical outcomes of rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) based on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) aspects.,1
"Osteoarthritis (OA) is an inflammatory disease that affects the cartilage and tissues around the joints, which results in excessive pain and stiffness. One of the most critical challenges for improving the therapeutic effect in OA treatments is the current drug design utilizing functional polymers. Indeed, there is a need to design and develop novel therapeutic drugs for positive outcomes. In this view, glucosamine sulfate is a drug used to manage OA because of its potential therapeutic effects on cartilage and ability to inhibit disease progression. This research aims to develop a keratin/chitosan/glucosamine sulfate (KRT/CS/GLS) composite loaded functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a potential carrier for the treatment of OA. The nanocomposite was developed using various ratios of KRT/CS/GLS, and MWCNT. Molecular docking analysis has been performed with (D-glucosamine) and targeted proteins (Protein Data Bank ID: 1HJV, 1ALU) to determine the binding affinity and interactions. Field emission scanning electron microscopy study showed that the composite KRT/CS/GLS incorporated on the surface of functionalized MWCNTs effectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of KRT/CS/GLS in the nanocomposite and remained intact. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the nature of the composite in MWCNT transformed from a crystalline to an amorphous state. Thermo gravimetric analysis revealed that the nanocomposite has a high thermal decomposition temperature of 420 °C. The MTT assay results showed that 83% of cell viability has remained in RAW 264.7 cells at the maximum concentration (500 μg ml<sup>-1</sup>) of MWCNT-GLS/KRT/CS nanocomposite. Also, molecular docking results revealed the excellent binding affinity of D-glucosamine to each protein structure (PDB ID: 1HJV and 1ALU).",0
"<b>Background.</b> Managing Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) hypersensitivity (HS) in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a challenge. Data on Rapid Desensitization (RD) to ASA is scarce.

"Oxidative stress, glycation and inflammation are the main causes of many severe diseases. To date, no single extract has been shown to simultaneously inhibit these three reactions. In this study, the antioxidant, antiglycation and anti-inflammatory activities of ethanol extracts from four edible plants that are commonly used as Thai folk medicine were compared. Among these extracts, Caesalpinia mimosoides extract (CME) showed the highest antioxidant potential with Trolox equivalent antioxidant activity (TEAC) of 5.9 ± 0.1 mM/mg followed closely by Zingiber officinale extract (ZOE) with a TEAC value of 5.4 ± 0.2 mM/mg. However, CME showed no cytotoxicity, whereas ZOE greater than 60 μg/mL showed cytotoxicity to normal human cells. Antiglycation assay using bovine serum albumin-ribose showed comparable potency between CME and Spondias dulcis extract (SDE). However, CME exhibited a high anti-inflammatory activity, significantly higher than SDE and activity depending on the dose. At a concentration of 60 μg/mL, approximately 85% of the interleukin-6 pro-inflammatory cytokine produced from human monocytes, induced by lipopolysaccharides, was completely inhibited by CME whereas SDE showed no inhibition. In summary, CME is the most potential extract with simultaneously activity of these three reactions. CME has the highest total phenolic content expressed as gallic acid equivalent to 301 ± 8 mg/g. Identification using high-performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of at least four phenolic compounds, gallic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ellagic acid are existed in CME. Our finding suggests that CME is a promising natural source for inhibition of oxidative stress, glycation, and inflammation.",0

According to mRNA sequences published by NCBI and the results of molecular biology experiments, the complete TsODC sequence was cloned and expressed. rTsODC had good immunogenicity, and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that TsODC was principally localized on the surface tissues of the nematode, especially at the head and tail. qRT‒PCR and Western blotting analysis indicated that the relative expression levels of TsODC mRNA and protein were highest when cultured at pH 2.5 for 2 h. The muscle larvae (ML) of T. spiralis were treated with curcumin and rapamycin, as well as arginine and TsODC polyantisera. The expression levels of TsODC mRNA and protein were significantly increased by arginine and suppressed by curcumin and rapamycin. After reducing the amount of TsODC, the relative expression of TsODC mRNA and the survival rate of T. spiralis ML were both reduced when compared to these values in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group. The results indicated that TsODC is a member of the T. spiralis AR system and different treatments on TsODC have different effects; thus, these treatments might be a new way to prevent T. spiralis infection.",0

"Antipsychotics have conflicting data with respect to obsessive-compulsive disorder/symptoms (OCD/OCS), with some reporting causality and some reporting treatment benefits. This pharmacovigilance study aimed to investigate reporting of OCD/OCS in association with the use of antipsychotics in comparison to one another, as well as treatment failure using data derived from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).",1
"A 56-year-old woman was treated for rheumatoid arthritis for 17 years with methotrexate (MTX). Night sweats, fever and weight loss made her visit our hospital. Although levofloxacin failed to resolve her fever, she was suspected of having sepsis because of pancytopenia, elevated procalcitonin and a nodular lesion in the lung. After urgent hospitalization, she was diagnosed finally with the methotrexate-related lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD) associated with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Her general condition was improved with MTX withdrawal and 5-day high-dose glucocorticoid administration. Thus, even when the patient was critically ill with MAS, no cytotoxic agents were required to control MTX-LPD.",1
"The data about the efficacy and safety of warfarin usage in atrial fibrillation (AF) in hemodialysis patients is still limited, especially in the Asia population. The population of this study was end-stage renal disease patients with AF who underwent hemodialysis. The design of the study was a retrospective observational cohort that collected the patient data from 2016 to 2019. The Cox regression model was applied to assess the effect of warfarin on the outcomes. We conducted a survival analysis by comparing Kaplan-Meier curves using the log-rank test. We also measured the time in therapeutic range as a quality indicator of warfarin usage. Among 444 hemodialysis patients, 126 patients with AF matched the inclusion criteria, 88 patients completely followed up. Half patients used warfarin. The mean age was 52.2 ± 12.97 years, the mean follow-up duration was 11 ± 10 months. We observed all-cause death in 86.4% of patients, ischemic stroke in 10.2%, and hemorrhagic stroke in 2.3% of patients. There were no significant differences in all-cause death, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. Warfarin use was not associated with a lower rate for death (HR 0.782; 95% CI, 0.494-1.237, P = 0.293) or ischemic stroke (HR 0.435; 95% CI, 0.103-1.846, P = 0.259) or hemorrhagic stroke (HR 0.564; 95% CI, 0.034-9.386, P = 0.689). None of the patients reach the time in the therapeutic range >65%. Our findings suggest that warfarin has no association with mortality, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke events rate in atrial fibrillation patients who underwent hemodialysis in the Indonesian population.",1

"A unique nanomaterial platform was developed for trace detection and efficient degradation of triclosan (TCS). A facile spectroscopic technique for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-supported identification and ultraviolet (UV) degradation of TCS using a SERS template based on silver spherical nanoparticle (AgNP)-modified ZnO multipods (ZnO@Ag) is reported. Core-shell composite materials of ZnO multipods with a dimension of around 3 μm and AgNPs with an average diameter of ∼27 nm was designed not only as a substrate for TCS degradation up to ∼92% upon UV irradiation (λ = 365 mm, 300 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>) but also as a monitoring platform sensitive to TCS at a detection limit as low as 10<sup>-9</sup> M (≈0.3 ppb). Herein, the first investigation into ZnO@Ag bimetallic composites is established for both the SERS-based detection and UV-assisted degradation of environmental TCS pollutants. The calibration curve was estimated to be linear at R<sup>2</sup> > 0.97. The validated technology was successfully used to determine the antibacterial agent and TCS in distilled or river water. The advantages of the ZnO@Ag template are highlighted over conventional detection and excellent degradation.",0

"Resistance to oral terbinafine, the most commonly used antifungal to treat dermatophytosis and onychomycosis worldwide, is being increasingly reported. In this study, we aimed to investigate the species distribution and prevalence of squalene epoxidase mutations among toenail dermatophyte isolates. Samples from 15,683 patients suspected of onychomycosis visiting the offices of dermatologists and podiatrists in the United States were analyzed. Clinical information was reviewed, and dermatophyte species with or without squalene epoxidase mutations were detected using multiplex real-time PCRs. The frequency of dermatophytes was 37.6%; of isolates belonging to the Trichophyton genus, 88.3% were the T. rubrum complex, and 11.2% were the T. mentagrophytes complex. Individuals aged >70 years exhibited higher infection rates for the T. mentagrophytes complex. The overall mutation rate among Trichophyton spp. was 3.7%, with a higher mutation rate detected in the T. mentagrophytes complex (4.3 vs. 3.6%). Commonly detected mutations were T1189C/Phe397Leu (34.5%), T1306C/Phe415Ser (16.0%), and C1191A/Phe397Leu (11.0%). Squalene epoxidase gene mutations associated with decreased terbinafine susceptibility have been identified in United States patients with toenail onychomycosis. Physicians should be aware of the risk factors for resistance development and engage in antifungal stewardship practices such as directed diagnosis and treatment of dermatophytosis and onychomycosis.",0
"In this study, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) was explored as a novel advanced oxidation process (AOP) for water decontamination. Samples with high concentration aqueous solutions of Diclofenac sodium (DCF) and 4-Chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) were treated by plasma systems. Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) with a 1 pin-electrode and multi-needle electrodes (3 pins) configurations were used. The plasma generated using argon as working gas was touching a stationary liquid surface in the case of pin electrode-APPJ while for multi-needle electrodes-APPJ the liquid sample was flowing during treatment. In both configurations, a commercial RF power supply was used for plasma ignition. Measurement of electrical signals enabled precise determination of power delivered from the plasma to the sample. The optical emission spectroscopy (OES) of plasma confirmed the appearance of excited reactive species in the plasma, such as hydroxyl radicals and atomic oxygen which are considered to be key reactive species in AOPs for the degradation of organic pollutants. Treatments were conducted with two different volumes (5 mL and 250 mL) of contaminated water samples. The data acquired allowed calculation of degradation efficiency and energy yield for both plasma sources. When treated with pin-APPJ, almost complete degradation of 5 mL DCF occurred in 1 min with the initial concentration of 25 mg/L and 50 mg/L, whereas 5 mL pCBA almost degraded in 10 min at the initial concentration of 25 mg/L and 40 mg/L. The treatment results with multi-needle electrodes system confirmed that DCF almost completely degraded in 30 min and pCBA degraded about 24 % in 50 min. The maximum calculated energy yield for 50 % removal was 6465 mg/kWh after treatment of 250 mL of DCF aqueous solution utilizing the plasma recirculation technique. The measurements also provided an insight to the kinetics of DCF and pCBA degradation. Degradation products and pathways for DCF were determined using LC-MS measurements.",0
"In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration placed a black-box warning (the most stringent warning for drugs) on all nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) stating that these agents may cause heart attacks and/or strokes. No level I evidence demonstrates that nonselective NSAIDs increase cardiovascular risk. An alternative hypothesis is that hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) indirectly causes cardiovascular disease (CVD) through decreased activity and NSAIDs are correlated with CVD as an arthritis treatment.",0
"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a common infectious complication during the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or post hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). For these patients, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends posaconazole or voriconazole for IFI prophylaxis. In clinical practice, however, there has been increased use of isavuconazole due to favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters despite limited data for this indication. The comparative prophylactic efficacy of antifungals in this patient population has not been reported, and an analysis is warranted.",1
"A link between gut dysbiosis and the pathogenesis of brain disorders has been identified. A role for gut bacteria in drug reward and addiction has been suggested but very few studies have investigated their impact on brain and behavioral responses to addictive drugs so far. In particular, their influence on nicotine's addiction-like processes remains unknown. In addition, evidence shows that glial cells shape the neuronal activity of the mesolimbic system but their regulation, within this system, by the gut microbiome is not established. We demonstrate that a lack of gut microbiota in male mice potentiates the nicotine-induced activation of sub-regions of the mesolimbic system. We further show that gut microbiota depletion enhances the response to nicotine of dopaminergic neurons of the posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA), and alters nicotine's rewarding and aversive effects in an intra-VTA self-administration procedure. These effects were not associated with gross behavioral alterations and the nicotine withdrawal syndrome was not impacted. We further show that depletion of the gut microbiome modulates the glial cells of the mesolimbic system. Notably, it increases the number of astrocytes selectively in the pVTA, and the expression of postsynaptic density protein 95 in both VTA sub-regions, without altering the density of the astrocytic glutamatergic transporter GLT1. Finally, we identify several sub-populations of microglia in the VTA that differ between its anterior and posterior sub-parts, and show that they are re-organized in conditions of gut microbiota depletion. The present study paves the way for refining our understanding of the pathophysiology of nicotine addiction.",0
"Introduction Anti-emetic interventions include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic strategies. Acupressure is a non-pharmacologic and non-invasive therapeutic method that involves applying physical pressure to acupuncture points with fingers or devices. The pericardium (PC6) acupoint is located on the palm side of the wrist between the palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis tendons, three fingers across the wrist starting at the wrist crease. Our first aim was to assess the effect of PC6 point acupressure on PONV after gynecological surgeries compared to intravenous (IV) ondansetron. Secondly, we aimed to assess the factors associated with the first<sup> </sup>and second hours (early) postoperative nausea scores. Methods This was a prospective, randomized, and single-centered intervention study conducted between November 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, in a tertiary care hospital. Sancaktepe Martyr Prof. Dr. Ilhan Varank Education and Research Hospital Ethical Committee provided ethical approval for this study on October 14, 2022 (No: E-46059653-020). Randomization was done using the lottery method. Patients, who were over the age of 18 with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical score of I, II, or III status and had undergone gynecologic surgery under general anesthesia, were included. Patients, who were ASA IV, under continuous use of opioids or corticoids, underwent surgery with regional anesthesia, or declined to participate in the study, were excluded. There were two comparisons in this study. First, we divided patients into two groups according to anti-emetic prevention. Patients, who received IV 4 mg ondansetron (Group O), and patients, who placed acupressure bands at the P6 points on both forearms (Group B). The second comparison was done to assess the factors associated with early postoperative nausea. Patients were divided into two groups according to the mean early postoperative nausea scores as low (< 4, Group 1) and high/moderate (≥ 4, Group 2). PONV and pain scores were collected at five-time points: the first, second, sixth, twelfth, and twenty-fourth hours after surgery. Results Of 102 patients, 50 were in Group O and 52 were in Group B. There was no significant difference in postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting scores. Fifty patients (50%), including 24 patients (48%) in Group O and 26 patients (52%) in Group B, experienced early moderate/high postoperative nausea in our study. According to the second comparison, 52 patients were in Group 1, and 50 patients were in Group 2. Operation time; first and second-hour pain scores; first, second, sixth, twelfth, and twenty-fourth-hour scores; and first and second-hour vomiting scores were all significantly different across groups. Conclusion The effect of PC6 point acupressure on early PONV compared to IV ondansetron was similar after gynecological surgeries. However, using only one anti-emetic treatment did not adequately relieve early PONV. Of all patients, 11 (10%) required an extra anti-emetic medication at the ward. 50% of patients experienced early moderate/high postoperative nausea in our study. Motion sickness history, operation time, and early postoperative pain scores were associated with early PONV.",1
"The present study aimed to develop a simple, robust, sensitive and effective stability-indicating reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method for simultaneous quantification of diacerein (DCN) and aceclofenac (ACE) in novel nanoemulgel formulation and commercial tablets in the presence of their main degradation product: rhein (RH) and diclofenac sodium (DLS), respectively. A fractional factorial design was used to screen the crucial independent factors, whereas a central composite design was used for the optimization of the chromatographic conditions. The separation was carried out on Phenomenex C18 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm), using a mobile phase consisting of phosphate buffer pH 3 (0.1% v/v orthophosphoric acid) and acetonitrile (40:60 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with detection at 264 nm. The analytes were exposed to a variety of stress conditions, including heat, alkali, acid, oxidation, photochemical, humidity and hydrolysis. DCN, ACE, RH and DLS were found to have retention times of 4.32 ± 0.15, 5.77 ± 0.07, 8.28 ± 0.20 and 9.10 ± 0.18 min, respectively. The percent recovery for all four analytes was found to be between 98 and 102, and the procedure was discovered to be linear in the range of 0.1-64 μg/mL with R2 value > 0.999. The established method was validated as per ICH guidelines and successfully used to assay DCN and ACE in their combined marketed tablet dosage form and developed nanoemulgel formulation.",0
Breakthrough seizures and status epilepticus require urgent management. Administration of intravenous push (IVP) levetiracetam has been demonstrated to be safe as compared to intravenous piggyback (IVPB). This transition can potentially offer faster time to administration and reduced drug and material cost.

"The objective of the systematic review is to analyze the efficacy of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in the prophylaxis of thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). We searched for clinical trials, cohort studies and meta-analyses published from January 1, 2012 to September 30, 2022. Articles that analyzed the efficacy of DOAC in the prevention of thrombosis recurrence, with or without comparison with antivitamin K (VKA) drugs, were selected. DOACs, specifically rivaroxaban and apixaban, were significantly less effective than VKAs in preventing recurrence of thrombosis in patients with APS and prior arterial thrombosis or the concomitant presence of two or three different antiphospholipid antibodies. The proportion of patients with severe bleeding as side effect are similar in those treated with DOAC and with VKA. The results argue against the use of DOAC in the treatment of patients with thrombotic APS.",1
"<b>Aim:</b> Examining the association between <i>HLA-A/B</i> alleles and different carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced cutaneous adverse reactions in the Chinese population. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies was conducted.

"The PARALLEL-HF study assessed the efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril in Japanese patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This open-label extension (OLE) assessed long-term safety with sacubitril/valsartan.Methods and Results: This study enrolled 150 patients who received sacubitril/valsartan 50 or 100 mg, b.i.d., in addition to optimal background heart failure (HF) therapy. A dose level of sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg, b.i.d., was targeted by Week 8. At OLE baseline, higher concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and urine cGMP, and lower concentrations of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), were observed in the sacubitril/valsartan core group (patients who received sacubitril/valsartan in both the core and extension study) than in the enalapril core group (patients who received enalapril in the core study and were then transitioned to sacubitril/valsartan). The mean exposure to study drug was 98.9%. There was no trend of worsening of HF at Month 12. No obvious changes in cardiac biomarkers were observed, whereas BNP and urine cGMP increased and NT-proBNP decreased in the enalapril core group, which was evident at Weeks 2-4 and sustained to Month 12.",1
"Blueberry extract (BE) is rich in phenols, especially anthocyanins. Anthocyanins regulate the inflammatory response in mice and may be related to gut microbiota and bile acid receptors.

"In this study, calcium-alginate beads were produced and characterized by ionic gelation technique using three different copolymers (gum arabic (GA), κ-carrageenan (CG), guar gum (GG)), and seven different phenolic compounds (tannic acid, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, naringin, and hesperidin). The effect of the viscosity of copolymer and water solubility of the phenolic compound on the size, shape, swelling, encapsulation efficiency (EE), loading capacity (LC), and production yield (PY) of the beads were investigated. In addition, the impact of the core material concentration in the calcium chloride solution on the EE was determined. The bead sizes increased by 6.8, 11.4, and 35.3 %, respectively, with the use of GA, CG, and GG. The EE of the beads ranged from 28.36 to 89.30 % and increased with increasing copolymer viscosity and decreasing water solubility of the phenolic compound. When the core material concentration difference between the alginate and calcium chloride solutions was reduced to zero, the EE of the gallic acid bead increased from 32.95 % to 89.05 %. The results of this study show that copolymer viscosity, the water solubility of core material, and the core material concentration difference between alginate and calcium solutions should be considered in ionic gelation applications.",0
"Cutibacterium acnes is associated with the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris (AV). The relationship between antibiotic-resistant C. acnes and AV remains unclear. The authors aimed to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant C. acnes and investigate the association of acne severity with topical and systemic treatments in patients with acne. Samples were collected of inflammatory and noninflammatory acne, including closed and open comedones and erythematous papules/pustules from the face of patients with mild to severe acne. The samples were cultured under anaerobic conditions for the isolation of C. acnes. Antibiotic susceptibility tests for erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, clindamycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were performed using the agar dilution method. From 153 patients, 143 viable C. acnes samples were isolated (93.5%). They were found resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (143/143, 100%), clindamycin (108/143, 75.5%), erythromycin (105/143, 73.4%), tetracycline (74/143, 51.7%), and doxycycline (73/143, 51.1%). There was no significant correlation between the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and acne severity. High-level resistant C. acnes correlated with higher clinical severity of acne in patients taking doxycycline (τ<sub>b</sub>  = 0.3). The present prevalence of antibiotic-resistant C. acnes was high in Thailand. Antibiotic stewardship in AV treatment should be encouraged to prevent further antibiotic resistance crises.",1

"Migraine has a prevalence of 10 % in Germany, making it the most common neurological disorder. Migraine is a prevalent disorder not only for neurologist, it's an everyday topic for general physicians and internal medicine as well. Acute migraine attacks are treated with analgesics or triptans. In case of frequent migraine attacks, there is an indication for medicinal and non-pharmacological migraine prophylaxis. Medications include beta-blockers, flunarizine, anticonvulsants, amitriptyline or, in the case of chronic migraine, onabotulinumtoxinA. If these drugs are not effective, are not tolerated or contraindicated, monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or the CGRP receptor can be used.",0
"Keratinocytes of the mammalian skin provide not only mechanical protection for the tissues, but also transmit mechanical, chemical, and thermal stimuli from the external environment to the sensory nerve terminals. Sensory nerve fibers penetrate the epidermal basement membrane and function in the tight intercellular space among keratinocytes. Here we show that epidermal keratinocytes produce hydrogen peroxide upon the activation of the NADPH oxidase dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1). This enzyme can be activated by increasing cytosolic calcium levels. Using DUOX1 knockout animals as a model system we found an increased sensitivity towards certain noxious stimuli in DUOX1-deficient animals, which is not due to structural changes in the skin as evidenced by detailed immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic analysis of epidermal tissue. We show that DUOX1 is expressed in keratinocytes but not in the neural sensory pathway. The release of hydrogen peroxide by activated DUOX1 alters both the activity of neuronal TRPA1 and redox-sensitive potassium channels expressed in dorsal root ganglia primary sensory neurons. We describe hydrogen peroxide, produced by DUOX1 as a paracrine mediator of nociceptive signal transmission. Our results indicate that a novel, hitherto unknown redox mechanism modulates noxious sensory signals.",0
"The regulation of detached ripening is significant for prolonging fruit shelf life. Although light quality and sucrose affecting strawberry fruit ripening have been widely reported, little information is available about how they co-regulate the strawberry detached ripening process. In this study, different light qualities (red light-RL, blue light-BL, and white light-WL) and 100 mM sucrose were applied to regulate the ripening of initial red fruits detached from the plant. The results showed RL-treated samples (RL + H<sub>2</sub>O, RL + 100 mM sucrose) had brighter and purer skin color with a higher L*, b*, and C* value, and promoted the ascorbic acid. Almost all light treatments significantly decreased TSS/TA (total soluble solid/titratable acid) and soluble sugar/TA ratio, which is exacerbated by the addition of sucrose. Blue or red light in combination with sucrose notably increased total phenolic content and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. In addition, blue or red light combined with sucrose increased abscisic acid (ABA) content and promoted ABA signaling by inducing ABA-INSENSITIVE 4 (<i>ABI4</i>) expression and inhibiting SUCROSE NONFERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 2.6 (<i>SnRK2.6</i>) expression. The strawberries exposed to blue and red light significantly improved auxin (IAA) content compared to the control (0 d), whereas the addition of sucrose inhibited IAA accumulation. Moreover, sucrose treatment suppressed the AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID 11 (<i>AUX/IAA11</i>) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 6 (<i>ARF6</i>) expression under different light qualities. Overall, these results indicated that RL/BL + 100 mM sucrose might promote the detached ripening of strawberries by regulating abscisic acid and auxin signaling.",0
"Molecular modifications have been practiced for more than a century and nowadays they are widely applied in food, pharmaceutical, or other industries to manipulate the physicochemical, bioactivity, metabolic/catabolic, and pharmacokinetic properties. Among various structural modifications, the esterification/<i>O</i>-acylation has been well-established in altering lipophilicity and bioactivity of parent bioactive compounds, especially natural polyphenolics, while maintaining their high biocompatibility. Meanwhile, various classic chemical and enzymatic protocols and other recently emerged cell factory technology are being employed as viable esterification strategies. In this contribution, the main motivations of phenolic esterification, including the tendency to replace synthetic alkyl phenolics with safer alternatives in the food industry to improve the bioavailability of phenolics as dietary supplements/pharmaceuticals, are discussed. In addition, the toxicity, metabolism, and commercial application of synthetic and natural phenolics are briefly introduced. Under these contexts, the mechanisms and reaction features of several most prevalent chemical and enzymatic esterification pathways are demonstrated. In addition, insights into the studies of esterification modification of natural phenolic compounds and specific pros/cons of various reaction systems with regard to their practical application are provided.",0

"In the present work chemical transformation of carboxymethylcellulose with curcumin in ester form has led to the development of target specific sustained release delivery system for curcumin in presence of liver esterases. We here report synthesis, characterizations (FTIR, SEM and XRD) curcumin-carboxymethylcellulose ester (Cur-CMC ester) and its target specific hydrolysis to release curcumin. Cur-CMC ester has been found stable when simulated in-vitro in gastric fluid (pH 1.2) and in intestinal fluid (pH 6.8). On in-vitro simulation in liver homogenate curcumin is released from Cur-CMC ester after hydrolysis in a consistent amount (∼43 %) for 5 h. The release of curcumin from ester was highest at pH 8.0 in presence of liver enzymes. The present study suggested that modified CMC support can not only be used for the delivery of curcumin in liver but also acts as prodrug system and released free curcumin in presence of liver esterases.",0
"The degradation of phenol from wastewater is crucial for environmental protection. Biological enzymes, such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP), have shown great potential in the degradation of phenol. In this research, we prepared a hollow CuO/Cu<sub>2</sub>O octahedron adsorbent with a carambola matrix shape through the hydrothermal method. The surface of the adsorbent was modified by silane emulsion self-assembly, where 3-aminophenyl boric acid (APBA) and polyoxometalate (PW<sub>9</sub>) were combined with silanization reagents and grafted onto the surface. The adsorbent was then molecularly imprinted with dopamine to obtain boric acid modified polyoxometalate molecularly imprinted polymer (Cu@B@PW<sub>9</sub>@MIPs). This adsorbent was used to immobilize HRP, which served as a biological enzyme catalyst from horseradish. The adsorbent was characterized, and its synthetic conditions, experimental conditions, selectivity, reproducibility, and reusability were evaluated. The maximum adsorption amount of HRP under optimized conditions was 159.1 mg g<sup>-1</sup>, as determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). At pH 7.0, the immobilized enzyme showed a high efficiency of up to 90.0% in removing phenol, after 20 min of reaction with 25 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 0.20 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> Cu@B@PW<sub>9</sub>@HRP. Growth tests of aquatic plants confirmed that the adsorbent reduced harm. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) tests revealed that the degraded phenol solution contained about fifteen phenol derivatives intermediates. This adsorbent has the potential to become a promising biological enzyme catalyst for dephenolization.",0
"Epigenetic mechanisms that dysregulate gene expressions may play a significant role in the development of neurological disorders. However, whether peptides can modulate epigenetic mechanisms remains elusive. This work aimed to investigate the impact of pretreatment with walnut-derived peptides─WHP and YVLLPSPK─on DNA methylation in a low-grade neuroinflammation model. The enriched KEGG pathways included oxidative phosphorylation, riboflavin metabolism, ribosome, and pyrimidine metabolism, which are associated with methylation modification by oral administration of YVLLPSPK in mice with scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits. Furthermore, when THP-1 cells (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation responses, both WHP and YVLLPSPK markedly inhibited the level of Il-6 to 2.05 ± 0.76 and 1.29 ± 0.19 (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and also declined the mRNA expression of Mcp-1 to 1.64 ± 0.02 and 3.29 ± 1.21 (<i>p</i> < 0.01), respectively. Meanwhile, YVLLPSPK decreased the activities of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to 1.03 ± 0.02 and 1.20 ± 0.31 (<i>p</i> < 0.05) based on Dnmt3b and Tet2, respectively. The results indicated that YVLLPSPK modulated DNA methylation in embryonic and neural precursor cells in creating new methylation patterns. Further trials are needed to assess the mechanisms underlying DNA methylation changes through peptides in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders.",0
"We report an unusual case of a 40-year-old male patient who experienced painful swelling of the left lower limb that persisted for 1 week. Imaging modalities not only confirmed the diagnosis of acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE), but also an incidental finding of interrupted inferior vena cava (IVC). This congenital anomaly is uncommon but rarely associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The azygos continuation was compressed by the descending aorta against the 11<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebrae, which was identified as the cause of VTE. He was treated successfully with anticoagulation and compression therapy. The patient was discharged with lifelong oral Rivaroxaban and remained asymptomatic. In the literature, only 9 cases of interrupted IVC-associated PE were identified but none was due to significant venous compression.",0
Lipid management with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal of < 1.4 mmol/L is recommended for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and diabetes mellitus (DM) due to a high risk for adverse cardiovascular events. This study evaluated the lipid-lowering treatment (LLT) pattern and the LDL-C goal attainment rate in this special population.,1
"The worldwide prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has significantly increased in the past decades. Scientific reports have shown CKD to be an enhancing risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of premature death in patients with CKD. Clinical practice guidelines are ambiguous in view of the use of antiplatelet drugs in patients with CKD because patients with moderate-to-severe CKD were often excluded from clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. In this analysis, we aimed to systematically assess the adverse cardiovascular and bleeding outcomes that were observed with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel use in patients with CKD and cardiovascular disease.",1

"There is mounting experimental evidence that blocking angiotensin receptor type 1 activity can prevent the occurrence of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Studies have proved this strategy via evasive means, such as intracerebrovascular injections, making clinical translation difficult. This study aimed to develop penetratin and transferrin functionalized liposomes as a delivery tool to safely deliver losartan potassium (an angiotensin receptor blocker) to the brain. Penetratin and transferrin functionalized losartan-loaded liposomes were prepared via the post-insertion technique. Losartan-loaded liposomes were cationic, approximately 150 nm in size, entrapping 66.8 ± 1.5% of losartan. All formulations were well tolerated and internalized by primary and cultured cells in 4 h. Further, the ability to deliver losartan potassium across the blood-brain barrier was evaluated in vivo in Wistar Kyoto rats either in solution or when encapsulated within liposomal nanoparticles. Upon intravenous administration, we did not find a detectable amount of losartan in the brain tissue of rats that received free losartan solution. Contrarily, liposome formulations could deliver losartan to the brain, with a brain AUC and mean resident time of 163.304 ± 13.09 and 8.623 h ± 0.66, respectively. In addition, no toxicity was observed in the animals that received the losartan-loaded liposomes.",0
There is little and controversial information about changes in plasma concentrations (PCs) or clinical events during coadministration of antiseizure medications (ASMs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).

"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that has been insufficiently studied in the pediatric population. Timely and effective medical treatments may improve quality of life, mitigate disease burden, and prevent the need for invasive procedural interventions such as surgical excisions. However, there is a paucity of research on the efficacy of medical management strategies for HS in children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the efficacy and safety of medical treatments for HS in patients <18 years of age. In April 2022, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles on the efficacy of medical treatments for HS in the pediatric population. Between 1984 and 2022, 35 articles (101 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Most patients had Hurley Stage II disease (46.7%, 35/75) followed by Stage I (36%, 27/75), and Stage III (17.3%, 13/75). 100% (23/23) of patients responded to antibiotics, 100% (8/8) to finasteride, 93.9% (31/33) to biologics, 80% (4/5) to oral retinoids, and 50% (6/12) to metformin. Overall, this study demonstrates that medical treatment regimens can improve HS symptoms in pediatric patients, but the extent of improvement is unclear, and the results were largely based on case reports or case series. Prospective studies are warranted to better understand the efficacy and safety of medical treatments for pediatric HS. Clinical trials of HS therapies need to be inclusive of pediatric patients to help define the optimal timing of treatment initiation and guide patient selection.",1
"<i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> is the conditional pathogenic bacteria, and pregnant women are at higher risk of infection due to depressed immunity. Infection with <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> in twin pregnancy is rare but devastating, which puts forwards a great challenge for clinical management. Here, a 24-year-old woman was diagnosed with twin pregnancy, intrauterine death of one fetus and fever at 29<sup>+4</sup> week of gestation. Two days later, she developed into pericardial effusion, pneumonedema and potential septic shock. The emergent cesarean delivery was performed after anti-shock treatment. One alive and another dead fetus were delivered. Then, she developed postpartum hemorrhage after the surgery. Urgent exploratory laparotomy was conducted at the sites of cesarean section and B-Lynch suture to stop bleeding. The culture of blood and maternal side of both placentas indicated <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. Following anti-infection therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam, she recovered well and discharged with negative result of blood bacterial culture and normal inflammatory indicators. The patient was hospitalized for a total of 18 days including 2 days in the intensive care unit (ICU), and the anti-infection treatment was conducted throughout the course. Symptoms of the <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection in pregnancy are non-specific, which should be paid more attention in case of unexplained fever and fetal distress. The blood culture is effective for accurate diagnosis. <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Close monitoring of fetal condition, early intervention with antibiotics, timely termination of pregnancy and comprehensive management of complications are essential for better prognosis.",1

"Metformin can enhance cancer cell chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs. IGF-1R is involved in cancer chemoresistance. The current study aimed to elucidate the role of metformin in osteosarcoma (OS) cell chemosensitivity modulation and identify its underlying mechanism in IGF-1R/miR-610/FEN1 signalling. IGF-1R, miR-610, and FEN1 were aberrantly expressed in OS and participated in apoptosis modulation; this effect was abated by metformin treatment. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that FEN1 is a direct target of miR-610. Moreover, metformin treatment decreased IGF-1R and FEN1 but elevated miR-610 expression. Metformin sensitised OS cells to cytotoxic agents, while FEN1 overexpression partly compromised metformin's sensitising effects. Furthermore, metformin was observed to enhance adriamycin's effects in a murine xenograft model. Metformin enhanced OS cell sensitivity to cytotoxic agents via the IGF-1R/miR-610/FEN1 signalling axis, highlighting its potential as an adjuvant during chemotherapy.",0
"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent condition characterized by episodes of partial or complete breath cessation during sleep that induces sleep fragmentation (SF). One of the frequent manifestations of OSA is the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with cognitive deficits. Solriamfetol (SOL) and modafinil (MOD) are wake-promoting agents commonly prescribed to improve wakefulness in OSA patients with EDS. This study aimed to assess the effects of SOL and MOD in a murine model of OSA characterized by periodic SF. Male C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to either control sleep (SC) or SF (mimicking OSA) during the light period (06:00 h to 18:00 h) for 4 weeks, which consistently induces sustained excessive sleepiness during the dark phase. Both groups were then randomly assigned to receive once-daily intraperitoneal injections of SOL (200 mg/kg), MOD (200 mg/kg), or vehicle for 1 week while continuing exposures to SF or SC. Sleep/wake activity and sleep propensity were assessed during the dark phase. Novel Object Recognition test, Elevated-Plus Maze Test, and Forced Swim Test were performed before and after treatment. SOL or MOD decreased sleep propensity in SF, but only SOL induced improvements in explicit memory, while MOD exhibited increased anxiety behaviors. Chronic SF, a major hallmark of OSA, induces EDS in young adult mice that is mitigated by both SOL and MOD. SOL, but not MOD, significantly improves SF-induced cognitive deficits. Increased anxiety behaviors are apparent in MOD-treated mice. Further studies aiming to elucidate the beneficial cognitive effects of SOL are warranted.",1

"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from toxins but hinders the penetration of neurotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, the blood-to-brain permeability of chemotherapeutics must be carefully evaluated. Here, we aimed to establish a workflow to generate primary cultures of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) to study drug brain permeability and bioavailability. Furthermore, we characterized and validated this BBB model in terms of quantitative expression of junction and drug-transport proteins, and drug permeability. We isolated brain microvessels (MVs) and cultured BMVECs from glioma patient biopsies. Then, we employed targeted LC-MS proteomics for absolute protein quantification and immunostaining to characterize protein localization and radiolabeled drugs to predict drug behavior at the Human BBB. The abundance levels of ABC transporters, junction proteins, and cell markers in the cultured BMVECs were similar to the MVs and correctly localized to the cell membrane. Permeability values (entrance and exit) and efflux ratios tested in vitro using the primary BMVECs were within the expected in vivo values. They correctly reflected the transport mechanism for 20 drugs (carbamazepine, diazepam, imipramine, ketoprofen, paracetamol, propranolol, sulfasalazine, terbutaline, warfarin, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, indinavir, methotrexate, ofloxacin, azidothymidine (AZT), indomethacin, verapamil, quinidine, and prazosin). We established a human primary in vitro model suitable for studying blood-to-brain drug permeability with a characterized quantitative abundance of transport and junction proteins, and drug permeability profiles, mimicking the human BBB. Our results indicate that this approach could be employed to generate patient-specific BMVEC cultures to evaluate BBB drug permeability and develop personalized therapeutic strategies.",0
"Tetracyclines are a class of broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotics used to treat many infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), acne, pelvic inflammatory disease, chlamydial infections, and a host of zoonotic infections. These drugs work by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacterial ribosomes, specifically by disallowing aminoacyl-tRNA molecules from binding to the ribosomal acceptor sites. While rare, tetracycline antibiotics, particularly minocycline and doxycycline, are associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal perforation and pseudotumor cerebri (PTC, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension). Since tetracyclines are a commonly prescribed class of medications, especially in adolescents for acne treatment, it is important for clinicians to appreciate significant side effects that can result in morbidity and mortality. This paper aims to consolidate and to emphasize current research on the association between tetracycline antibiotics and the development of esophageal perforation, and PTC. PTC is a neurological syndrome consisting of increased intracranial pressure, headache, and vision changes without evidence of the contributing source, such as mass lesion, infection, stroke, or malignancy. Esophageal perforation, while rare, can be the result of pill esophagitis. Pill-induced injuries occur when caustic medicinal pills dissolve in the esophagus rather than in the stomach. Most patients experience only self-limited pain (retrosternal burning discomfort, heartburn, dysphagia, or odynophagia), but hemorrhage, stricture, and perforation may occur. Tetracycline use can lead to pill esophagitis. In summary, clinicians should appreciate the potential risks of tetracycline compounds in clinical practice.",1

"Pickering emulsions represent a promising avenue in the field of controlled drug delivery systems. Recently, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and chitosan nanofibers (ChNFs) have gained interest as eco-friendly stabilizers for Pickering emulsions, yet their application in pH-responsive drug delivery systems remains unexplored. However, the potential of these biopolymer complexes in formulating stable, pH-responsive emulsions for controlled drug release is of significant interest. Here, we show the development of a highly stable, pH-responsive fish oil-in-water Pickering emulsion stabilized by ChNF/CNF complexes, with optimal stability achieved at a 0.2 wt% ChNF concentration and an average emulsion particle size of approximately 4 μm. Our results demonstrate long-term stability (16 days of storage) for ChNF/CNF-stabilized emulsions, with the interfacial membrane's pH modulation facilitating controlled, sustained ibuprofen (IBU) release. Furthermore, we observed a remarkable release of approximately 95 % of the embedded IBU within the pH range of 5-9, while the drug loading and encapsulation efficiency of the drug-loaded microspheres reached their peak at a 1 % IBU dosage, with values of 1 % and 87 %, respectively. This study highlights the potential of using ChNF/CNF complexes in designing versatile, stable, and entirely renewable Pickering systems for controlled drug delivery, with potential applications in food and eco-friendly products.",0
"Multimodal combined therapy (MCT) is an emerging avenue to eliminate tumor cells by the synergistic effect of various therapeutic methods. However, the complex tumor microenvironment (TME) is becoming the key barrier to the therapeutic effect of MCT due to the excessive existence of H<sup>+</sup> ions, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and glutathione (GSH), the lack of O<sub>2</sub>, and the relaxation of ferroptosis. To overcome these limitations, smart nanohybrid gels with excellent biocompatibility, stability and targeting function were prepared by using gold nanoclusters as cores and an in situ cross-linking composite gel of sodium alginate (SA)/hyaluronic acid (HA) as the shell. The obtained Au NCs-Cu<sup>2+</sup>@SA-HA core-shell nanohybrid gels possessed near-infrared light response synergistically benefitting photothermal imaging guided photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Meanwhile, the H<sup>+</sup>-triggered release of Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions from the nanohybrid gels not only induces cuproptosis to avoid the relaxation of ferroptosis, but also catalyzes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the TME to generate O<sub>2</sub> to simultaneously improve the hypoxic microenvironment and PDT effect. Furthermore, the released Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions could consume the excessive GSH to form Cu<sup>+</sup> ions effectively, which caused the formation of hydroxyl free radicals (·OH) to kill tumor cells, synergistically realizing GSH consumption-enhanced PDT and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Hence, the novel design in our work provides another research avenue for cuproptosis-enhanced PTT/PDT/CDT via TME modulation.",0

"This work aimed to investigate Sinapis pubescens subsp. pubescens spontaneously grown in Sicily (Italy) as new potential source of active metabolites; specifically, a comparative study on leaf, flower, and stem hydroalcoholic extracts was performed. Polyphenols were quantitatively determined by spectrophotometric methods and characterized by HPLC-PDA/ESI-MS; a total of 55 polyphenolic compounds were identified, highlighting considerably different qualitative-quantitative profiles. The extracts showed antioxidant activity, evaluated by in vitro assays; particularly, the leaf extract displayed the best radical scavenging activity (DPPH test) and reducing power, while the flower extract showed the greatest chelating activity. The antimicrobial properties of the extracts were investigated against bacteria and yeasts by standard methods; no antimicrobial activity was found against the strains tested. The extracts resulted to be non-toxic after preliminary toxicity evaluation by the Artemia salina lethality bioassay. The aerial parts of S. pubescens subsp. pubescens proved to be valuable sources of antioxidants for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.",0

"<i>Ocimum</i> is considered the largest genus in the Lamiacea family. The genus includes basil, a group of aromatic plants with a wide range of culinary uses that nowadays draws attention for its medicinal and pharmaceutical potential. This systematic review intends to explore the chemical composition of nonessential oils and their variation across different <i>Ocimum</i> species. Moreover, we aimed to identify the state of knowledge regarding the molecular space in this genus as well as the different methods of extraction/identification and geographical location. Seventy-nine eligible articles were selected for the final analysis, from which we extracted more than 300 molecules. We found that the countries with the highest number of studies into <i>Ocimum</i> species are India, Nigeria, Brazil, and Egypt. However, from all known species of <i>Ocimum</i>, only 12 were found to have an extensive chemical characterization, particularly <i>Ocimum basilicum and Ocimum tenuiflorum</i>. Our study focused especially on alcoholic, hydroalcoholic, and water extracts, in which the main techniques for compound identifications are GC-MS, LC-MS, and LC-UV. Across the compiled molecules, we found a wide variety of compounds, especially flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoids, suggesting that this genus could be a very useful source of possible bioactive compounds. The information collected in this review also emphasizes the huge gap between the vast number of <i>Ocimum</i> species discovered and the number of studies in each of them that determined the chemical characterization.",0

"A strategy to enhance the peroxidase-like activity of the hemin composite is presented. The Cu-Salt-Fe with enhanced activity was synthesized by one-step heat treatment and applied to the colorimetric determination of free cholesterol in human serum. Phosphate can act in complexing Cu<sup>2+</sup> to form a carrier Cu-Floc with a large specific surface area. The coordination effect of Cu-Floc with hemin was used to disperse and load hemin to form Cu-Floc-Hemin from which Cu-Salt-Fe was prepared. The Cu-Salt-Fe exhibits a synergistic catalytic effect of Cu-Salt, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, or Fe-Nx active sites in amplification of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation. As expected, Cu-Salt-Fe triggered H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), resulting in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent absorbance changes at 652 nm. A cholesterol oxidase (ChOx)/Cu-Salt-Fe-TMB colorimetric sensing system exhibited excellent cholesterol determination performance in the range 5-1200 μM with a detection limit of 2.73 μM. Cholesterol recoveries from the three-level spiked serum ranged from 92.2 to 98.9% (RSD ≤ 5.4). This colorimetric sensing system not only provided a strategy for the determination of endogenous substances with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an intermediate, but also provided a new design idea (carrier selection, activity enhancement method) for the development of other artificial enzymes with the same catalytic core.",0

"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play a critical role in the damage caused to the body by environmental exogenous chemicals; however, few studies have explored their effects during exposure to benzene and its metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ). An emerging lncRNA, LINC01480, was found to be associated with the immune microenvironment of some cancers, but its specific function remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of LINC01480 in HQ-induced apoptosis. The biological function of LINC01480 was investigated through gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. Mechanically, nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation experiment, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), dual-luciferase reporter assay, and rescue experiments were performed. In this study, when TK6 cells were treated with HQ (0, 5, 10, and 20 μM) for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, the expression of LINC01480 was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and AKT decreased, and apoptosis increased. As compared to the control group, HQ-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced, and the relative survival rate of TK6 cells increased after silencing LINC01480, while overexpression of LINC01480 further sensitized TK6 cells to HQ-induced apoptotic cell death. LINC01480 negatively regulated the PI3K/AKT pathway in TK6 cells, and the apoptosis-inhibiting effect of LINC01480 silencing was reversed after inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, ChIP and the dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that the transcription factor Foxo3a promoted LINC01480 transcription by directly binding to the promoter regions - 149 to - 138 of LINC01480. Moreover, short-term HQ exposure promoted the expression of Foxo3a. From these findings, we can conclude that LINC01480 is activated by Foxo3a, and promotes HQ-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, suggesting that LINC01480 might become a possible target for therapeutic intervention of HQ-induced toxicity.",0
"Elderly patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) might have a higher risk of intracerebral hemorrhage.

"Moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin are the two newer broad-spectrum 8-methoxy-quinolone derivatives that are used to treat various bacterial infections in cardiac patients. In this research study, we assessed the impact of moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin on the QT intervals of electrocardiograms in normal adult doses and draw a comparison, in a controlled environment, on healthy volunteers. Additionally, the effect of both test drugs on the QRS complex was checked. Sixty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to two groups via R-software, and each respectively received moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin for five days. The research ethics committee approved the research, and it was registered for clinical trial under NCT04692623. The participants' electrocardiograms were obtained before the start of the dose (baseline) and on the fifth day. Significant prolongation of QT interval was noted in moxifloxacin (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) as compared to gemifloxacin treated groups. There were no cases of QTc prolongation over the usual limits (450-470 ms) in the gemifloxacin-treated group, however, QTc prolongations at the rate of 30 and 60 ms from the baseline were noted, interpreted as per the EMEA guidelines. These findings indicate that moxifloxacin caused significant (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) QT interval prolongation (QTIP) as compared to gemifloxacin. In contrast to the previously reported literature, the prominent effect of moxifloxacin on the widening of the QRS-complex was noted with no such effect on QRS-widening in the gemifloxacin-treated group. It is concluded that both drugs have the potential for considerable QT interval prolongation (QTIP) effects, which is one of the risk factors for developing torsade de pointes (TdPs) in cardiac patients. Thus, clinicians should exercise caution when prescribing moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin to cardiac patients and should consider alternate treatment options.",1
"The authors evaluated the efficacy, safety, and characteristics of patients who respond well to standard dose triple combination therapy including chlorthalidone 25 mg with telmisartan 80 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg in hypertensive patients. This is a multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3, randomized trial. Patients are randomized to triple combination (telmisartan 40 mg/amlodipine 5 mg/chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, TEL/AML/CHTD group) or dual combination (telmisartan 40 mg/amlodipine 5 mg, TEL/AML group) treatment and then dose up titration to TEL 80/AML5/CHTD25mg and TEL80/AML5, respectively. The primary endpoint is the change of mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) at week 8. A Target BP achievement rate, a response rate, and the safety endpoints are also evaluated. Total 374 patients (mean age = 60.9 ± 10.7 years, male = 78.3%) were randomized to the study. The baseline MSSBPs/diastolic BPs were 149.9 ± 12.2/88.5 ± 10.4 mm Hg. After 8 weeks treatment, the change of MSSBPs at week 8 are -19.1 ± 14.9 mm Hg (TEL/AML/CHTD) and -11.4 ± 14.7 mm Hg (TEL/AML) (p < .0001). The achievement rates of target BP (53.8% vs. 37.8%, p = .0017) and responder rate (54.8% vs. 35.6%, p = .0001) at week 8 were significantly higher in TEL/AML/CHTD. There are no serious adverse event and no one discontinued medication due to adverse event. Among the TEL 80/AML5/CHTD25mg treatment group, patients of female or age ≥ 65 years old showed higher rate of target BP achievement than relatively young male. (61.4 vs. 46.8%, p = .042) Our study showed standard dose triple combination of telmisartan 80 mg/amlodipine 5 mg/chlorthalidone 25 mg is efficacious and safe in treatment of primary hypertension. Target BP achievement with triple therapy would be facilitated in female or old age.",1
"The current study was conducted around the province of Haldwani City, Uttarakhand, India, to understand the seasonal variation of ambient air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5,</sub> PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>) and their impact on four tree species, i.e., neem (Azadirachta indica), mountain cedar (Toona ciliate), bottlebrush (Callistemon citrinus), and guava (Psidium guajava) during 2020-2021. Multiple linear regression (MLR)-based prediction analysis showed that the selected air quality variables (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>) had a significant impact on the biochemical responses of selected tree spp. including, pH, ascorbic acid (AA), total chlorophyll content (T. Chl.), relative water content (RWC), and dust deposition potential. In this, the coefficient of variance (R<sup>2</sup>) of the developed models was in the range of 0.70-0.98. The ambient air pollutants showed significant seasonal variations as depicted by using the air pollution tolerance index (APTI) and anticipated performance index (API). The tree species from polluted sites observed more pollution tolerance than the tree species from the control site. Regression analysis showed a significant positive association between the biochemical characteristics and APTI, with the highest influence by AA (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.961) followed by T. Chl., RWC, and pH. The APTI and API score was observed as maximum for A. indica and minimum for C. citrinus. The impact of air pollutants on the morphology of foliar surface was investigated by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and recorded various dust deposition patterns, stomatal blockages, and damage of guard cells in the trees growing along the polluted site (S2). The present study can assist environmental managers to examine the pollution-induced variables and develop an effective green belt for combating air pollution in polluted areas.",0
"Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic bacterium with a widespread distribution that can cause diverse severe diseases. The membrane-bound nitrate reductase NarGHJI serves respiratory function. However, little is known about its contribution to virulence. In this study, we demonstrated that <i>narGHJI</i> disruption results in the downregulation of virulence genes (e.g., <i>RNAIII</i>, <i>agrBDCA</i>, <i>hla</i>, <i>psmα</i>, and <i>psmβ</i>) and reduces the hemolytic activity of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain USA300 LAC. Moreover, we provided evidence that NarGHJI participates in regulating host inflammatory response. A mouse model of subcutaneous abscess and Galleria mellonella survival assay demonstrated that the <i>ΔnarG</i> mutant was significantly less virulent than the wild type. Interestingly, NarGHJI contributes to virulence in an <i>agr</i>-dependent manner, and the role of NarGHJI differs between different S. aureus strains. Our study highlights the novel role of NarGHJI in regulating virulence, thereby providing a new theoretical reference for the prevention and control of S. aureus infection. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Staphylococcus aureus is a notorious pathogen that poses a great threat to human health. The emergence of drug-resistant strains has significantly increased the difficulty of preventing and treating S. aureus infection and enhanced the pathogenic ability of the bacterium. This indicates the importance of identifying novel pathogenic factors and revealing the regulatory mechanisms through which they regulate virulence. The nitrate reductase NarGHJI is mainly involved in bacterial respiration and denitrification, which can enhance bacterial survival. We demonstrated that <i>narGHJI</i> disruption results in the downregulation of the <i>agr</i> system and <i>agr</i>-dependent virulence genes, suggesting that NarGHJI participates in the regulation of S. aureus virulence in an <i>agr</i>-dependent manner. Moreover, the regulatory approach is strain specific. This study provides a new theoretical reference for the prevention and control of S. aureus infection and reveals new targets for the development of therapeutic drugs.",0
"Orlistat, an FDA-approved fatty acid inhibitor for obesity treatment, demonstrates certain low and greatly varied anticancer abilities. In a previous study, we revealed a synergistic effect between orlistat and dopamine in cancer treatment. Here, orlistat-dopamine conjugates (ODCs) with defined chemical structures were synthesized. The ODC by design underwent polymerization and self-assembly in the presence of oxygen to form nano-sized particles (Nano-ODCs) spontaneously. The resulted Nano-ODCs of partial crystalline structures demonstrated good water dispersion to form stable Nano-ODC suspensions. Because of the bioadhesive property of the catechol moieties, once administered, Nano-ODCs were quickly accumulated on cell surfaces and efficiently uptaken by cancer cells. In the cytoplasm, Nano-ODC experienced biphasic dissolution followed by spontaneous hydrolysis to release intact orlistat and dopamine. Besides elevated levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), the co-localized dopamine also induced mitochondrial dysfunctions through monoamine oxidases (MAOs)-catalyzed dopamine oxidation. The strong synergistic effects between orlistat and dopamine determined a good cytotoxicity activity and a unique cell lysis mechanism, explaining the distinguished activity of Nano-ODC to drug-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells. This new technology-enabled orlistat repurposing will contribute to overcoming drug resistance and the improvement of cancer chemotherapy.",0
"Developing naturally active components to control α-amylase/α-glucosidase activity is highly desired for preventing and managing type 2 diabetes. Rapeseed oil is rich in active phenolic compounds and seed oil is a major source of liposoluble inhibitors to these enzymes. However, it remains unclear about the interaction of phenolic compounds in rapeseed oil with α-amylase/α-glucosidase. This study found that the important phenolic compounds from rapeseed oil (Sinapic acid, SA; canolol, CAO; canolol dimer, CAO dimer) possessed effective inhibition performance against α-amylase and α-glucosidase. CAO showed the lowest and highest inhibitory effect, respectively. In the kinetics studies, the inhibition mechanism of SA/CAO/CAO dimer against α-glucosidase was non-competitive, exhibiting a different way from α-amylase. Fluorescence quenching spectra implied that the static processes were responsible for the spontaneous binding between the compounds and enzymes. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) displayed these compounds-induced conformation alterations of α-amylase/α-glucosidase. Molecular docking revealed that SA/CAO/CAO dimer decreased the catalytic efficiency of α-amylase/α-glucosidase through hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic force, or π-π interaction. Molecular dynamics matched well with the experimental and docking results regarding the inhibitory behaviors and interactions toward α-amylase/α-glucosidase. These results demonstrated the potential benefits of phenolic compounds from rapeseed oil in antidiabetic-related activities.",0

"Exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxin (TCDD) has been associated with the induction of oxidative stress and the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis. It also disrupts metabolic pathways including one-carbon metabolism (OCM) and the transsulfuration pathway with possible consequences on glutathione (GSH) levels. In this study, complementary RNAseq and metabolomics data were integrated to examine the hepatic transsulfuration pathway and glutathione biosynthesis in mice following treatment with TCDD every 4 days for 28 days. TCDD dose-dependently repressed hepatic cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) mRNA and protein levels. Reduced CBS and CTH levels are also correlated with dose-dependent decreases in hepatic extract hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). In contrast, cysteine levels increased consistent with the induction of <i>Slc7a11</i>, which encodes for the cystine/glutamate Xc<sup>-</sup> antiporter. Cotreatment of primary hepatocytes with sulfasalazine, a cystine/glutamate Xc<sup>-</sup> antiporter inhibitor, decreased labeled cysteine incorporation into GSH with a corresponding increase in TCDD cytotoxicity. Although reduced and oxidized GSH levels were unchanged following treatment due to the induction of GSH/GSSG efflux transporter by TCDD, the GSH:GSSG ratio decreased and global protein S-glutathionylation levels in liver extracts increased in response to oxidative stress along with the induction of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (<i>Gclc</i>), glutathione synthetase (<i>Gss</i>), glutathione disulfide reductase (<i>Gsr</i>), and glutathione transferase π (<i>Gstp</i>). Furthermore, levels of ophthalmic acid, a biomarker of oxidative stress indicating GSH consumption, were also increased. Collectively, the data suggest that increased cystine transport due to cystine/glutamate Xc<sup>-</sup> antiporter induction compensated for decreased cysteine production following repression of the transsulfuration pathway to support GSH synthesis in response to TCDD-induced oxidative stress.",0
"Ibuprofen and acetaminophen as two anti-fever agents have been widely used in human. Due to lack of full understanding, this work firstly summarized their occurrence and fate in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across 30 countries. The respective influent concentrations of ibuprofen and acetaminophen were not detected (ND)-39,830,000 and ND-66440000 ng/L, while their corresponding respective effluent concentrations were ND-58710 and ND-90500 ng/L. The removal efficiencies of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in municipal WWTPs were 6.5-100 % and 14.3-100 % with respective average removal efficiencies of 87.6 % and 94.7 %. There have been many batch studies on ibuprofen biodegradation with k<sub>bio</sub> values available, while such investigation for acetaminophen was very limited. The theoretically calculated removal efficiency of ibuprofen with k<sub>bio</sub> agreed well with that of the observed average removal efficiency of on-site investigations on full-scale WWTP, which was quite different from natural estrogens and some other emerging contaminants. One possible reason is that conjugated ibuprofen could be easily cleaved and the cleavage step gives little effect on the biodegradation of ibuprofen. Due to extremely high concentrations of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in influent of municipal WWTP, their concentration levels in effluent likely high enough to pose adverse effects on some aquatic organisms. To protect water environment, advanced treatment is necessary to further remove residue ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the effluent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the systematical summarization on the occurrence and fate of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in municipal WWTP as well as their potential effect on aquatic organisms, which addressed known knowledge and unknowns to be further investigated.",0

"The abnormal accumulation of fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a pathological hallmark in a proportion of patients with frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, the clearance of FUS aggregates is a possible therapeutic strategy for FUS-associated neurodegenerative diseases. This study reports that curcumin can strongly suppress FUS droplet formation and stress granule aggregation of FUS. Fluorescence spectra and isothermal titration calorimetry showed that curcumin can bind FUS through hydrophobic interactions, thereby reducing the β-sheet content of FUS. Aggregated FUS sequesters pyruvate kinase, leading to reduced ATP levels. However, results from a metabolomics study revealed that curcumin changed the metabolism pattern and differentially expressed metabolites were enriched in glycolysis. Curcumin attenuated FUS aggregation-mediated sequestration of pyruvate kinase and restored cellular metabolism, consequently increasing ATP levels. These results indicate that curcumin is a potent inhibitor of FUS liquid-liquid phase separation and provide novel insights into the effect of curcumin in ameliorating abnormal metabolism.",0
"Background Empiric antimicrobial therapy with azithromycin is highly used in patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, despite prior research suggesting that azithromycin may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. Methods and Results This study was conducted using data from the ISACS-COVID-19 (International Survey of Acute Coronavirus Syndromes-COVID-19) registry. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for inclusion. The study included 793 patients exposed to azithromycin within 24 hours from hospital admission and 2141 patients who received only standard care. The primary exposure was cardiovascular disease (CVD). Main outcome measures were 30-day mortality and acute heart failure (AHF). Among 2934 patients, 1066 (36.4%) had preexisting CVD. A total of 617 (21.0%) died, and 253 (8.6%) had AHF. Azithromycin therapy was consistently associated with an increased risk of AHF in patients with preexisting CVD (risk ratio [RR], 1.48 [95% CI, 1.06-2.06]). Receiving azithromycin versus standard care was not significantly associated with death (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.69-1.28]). By contrast, we found significantly reduced odds of death (RR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42-0.79]) and no significant increase in AHF (RR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.75-2.04]) in patients without prior CVD. The relative risks of death from the 2 subgroups were significantly different from each other (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.01). Statistically significant association was observed between AHF and death (odds ratio, 2.28 [95% CI, 1.34-3.90]). Conclusions These findings suggest that azithromycin use in patients with COVID-19 and prior history of CVD is significantly associated with an increased risk of AHF and all-cause 30-day mortality.

"The development of oral contraceptives (OCs) began in 1921 and continued in the following years until the first regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration was granted in 1960. However, it took several years to realize that OCs presented an important but not frequent risk of venous thrombosis. Several reports ignored this dangerous effect and only in 1967 the Medical Research Council clearly stated this as an important risk. Later, research led to the formulation of second-generation OCs containing progestins, which nevertheless presented an increased thrombotic risk. In early 1980s, OCs containing third-generation progestins were introduced into the market. Only in 1995, it became clear that these new compounds induced a higher thrombotic risk than that related to the second-generation progestins. It appeared clear that the modulating action of progestins was against the procoagulant activity of estrogens. Lastly, at the end of the 2000s, OCs containing natural estrogens and a fourth-generation progestin (dienogest) became available. The prothrombotic effect of those natural products was not different from that of preparations containing second-generation progestins. Moreover, research over the years has produced much data on risk factors associated with OCs use such as age, obesity, cigarette smoking, and thrombophilia. These findings allowed us to better assess the individual thrombotic risk (both arterial and thrombotic) of each woman before offering an OC. Furthermore, research has shown that in high-risk people the use of single progestin is not dangerous as far as thrombosis is concerned. In conclusion, the OCs road has been long and difficult but has led to a great and unthinkable scientific and social enrichment since the 1960s.",0
"Several chemicals with widespread consumer uses have been identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), with a potential risk to humans. The occurrence in indoor dust and resulting human exposure have been reviewed for six groups of known and suspected EDCs, including phthalates and non-phthalate plasticizers, flame retardants, bisphenols, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), biocides and personal care product additives (PCPs). Some banned or restricted EDCs, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), bisphenol A (BPA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are still widely detected in indoor dust in most countries, even as the predominating compounds of their group, but generally with decreasing trends. Meanwhile, alternatives that are also potential EDCs, such as bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), and PFAS precursors, such as fluorotelomer alcohols, have been detected in indoor dust with increasing frequencies and concentrations. Associations between some known and suspected EDCs, such as phthalate and non-phthalate plasticizers, FRs and BPs, in indoor dust and paired human samples indicate indoor dust as an important human exposure pathway. Although the estimated daily intake (EDI) of most of the investigated compounds was mostly below reference values, the co-exposure to a multitude of known or suspected EDCs requires a better understanding of mixture effects.",0

"Organic pollutants produced during industrial production are putting more stress on natural water resources. It is a considerable challenge to realize water remediation from organic pollutants in a cost-effective way. Here, we report a feasible method to fabricate Fe<sub>3</sub>N-decorated porous carbon frameworks (F/M-Fe) by one-step pyrolysis of wheat flour, melamine and metal ions. The prepared F/M-Fe possessing intrinsic peroxidase (POD)- and catalase (CAT)-like activities could effectively remove organic pollutants, which could be deduced from the degradation of methylene blue trihydrate (MB), rhodamine B (RhB), and tetracycline (TC) as pollutant simulants, as well as excess H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> without consuming additional resources and energy. The degradation process was facilitated by the primary active intermediates of ˙OH and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in the catalytic pathway, with efficiencies of 95.8% for MB, 91.6% for RhB, and 92.3% for TC achieved within 10, 50, and 70 min, respectively. Thanks to the encouraging recycling behavior and well-conditioned tolerance, F/M-Fe shows satisfactory catalytic performance on a proof-of-concept filter-type device for MB degradation. In addition, F/M-Fe could reduce organic pollutants to a safe level, under which zebrafish can survive well, which exhibited the potential value of F/M-Fe in water remediation.",0

"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), also known as Lyell's syndrome, is a severe episodic mucocutaneous reaction that is usually brought on by oral medications and/or sporadically by infections. We report a case of a 19-year-old male with the presenting complaint of generalized skin blistering over the previous seven days at the dermatology outpatient clinic. The patient has had epilepsy since he was 10 years old. Due to an upper respiratory tract illness, a local healthcare facility recommended oral levofloxacin to him seven days ago. Levofloxacin-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) was suspected based on the patient's medical history, physical examination, and research. On the basis of histological investigations and clinical correlation, the diagnosis of TEN was determined. The mainstay of treatment after diagnosis was made was supportive care. The best methods for treating TEN involve stopping any potential causal agents and providing supportive care. The patient received care in the intensive care unit.",1

"A number of studies have shown that aspirin, as commonly prescribed drug, prevents the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferroptosis as a dynamic tumor suppressor plays a vital role in hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study we investigated whether aspirin affected ferroptosis in liver cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that aspirin up-regulated 4 ferroptosis-related drivers and down-regulated 5 ferroptosis-related suppressors in aspirin-treated HepG2 cells. Treatment with aspirin (4 mM) induced remarkable ferroptosis in HepG2 and Huh7 cells, which was enhanced by the ferroptosis inducer erastin (10 μM). We demonstrated that NF-κB p65 restricted ferroptosis in HepG2 and Huh7 cells through directly binding to the core region of SLC7A11 promoter and activating the transcription of ferroptosis inhibitor SLC7A11, whereas aspirin induced ferroptosis through inhibiting NF-κB p65-activated SLC7A11 transcription. Overexpression of p65 rescued HepG2 and Huh7 cells from aspirin-induced ferroptosis. HCC patients with high expression levels of SLC7A11 and p65 presented lower survival rate. Functionally, NF-κB p65 blocked the aspirin-induced ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo, which was attenuated by erastin. We conclude that aspirin triggers ferroptosis by restricting NF-κB-activated SLC7A11 transcription to suppress the growth of HCC. These results provide a new insight into the mechanism by which aspirin regulates ferroptosis in hepatocarcinogenesis. A combination of aspirin and ferroptosis inducer may provide a potential strategy for the treatment of HCC in clinic.",1
"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in the United States, affecting approximately 1.2% of the population. Some people with epilepsy may experience seizure clusters, which are acute repetitive seizures that differ from the person's usual seizure pattern. Seizure clusters are unpredictable, are emotionally burdensome to patients and caregivers (including care partners), and require prompt treatment to prevent progression to serious outcomes, including status epilepticus and associated morbidity (e.g., lacerations, fractures due to falls) and mortality. Rescue medications for community use can be administered to terminate a seizure cluster, and benzodiazepines are the cornerstone of rescue treatment. Despite the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and the importance of a rapid treatment approach, as many as 80% of adult patients do not use rescue medication to treat seizure clusters. This narrative review provides an update on rescue medications used for treatment of seizure clusters, with an emphasis on clinical development and study programs for diazepam rectal gel, midazolam nasal spray, and diazepam nasal spray. Results from long-term clinical trials have shown that treatments for seizure clusters are effective. Intranasal benzodiazepines provide ease of use and patient and caregiver satisfaction in pediatric and adult patients. Adverse events attributed to acute rescue treatments have been characterized as mild to moderate, and no reports of respiratory depression have been attributed to treatment in long-term safety studies. The implementation of an acute seizure action plan to facilitate optimal use of rescue medications provides an opportunity for improved management of seizure clusters, allowing those affected to resume normal daily activities more quickly.",1
"Cardioembolic stroke is the second leading cause of mortality and the leading cause of long-term morbidity. Embolisms of cardiac origin, such as atrial fibrillation, represent about one-fifth of all ischemic strokes. Patients with acute atrial fibrillation frequently require anticoagulation, which increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. A 67-year-old woman was brought to the Emergency Department with decreased consciousness, weakness on the left side, facial expression, and slurred speech. The patient had a history of atrial fibrillation and was taking regular medications acarbose, warfarin, candesartan and bisoprolol. She has had an ischemic stroke about a year ago. Left hemiparesis, hyperreflexias, pathologic reflexes, and central type of facial nerve palsy were found. The CT-Scan results revealed hyperacute to acute thromboembolic cerebral infraction in the frontotemporoparietal lobe to the right basal ganglia accompanied by hemorrhagic transformation. Massive cerebral infarction, history of previous stroke, and use of anticoagulants are among the greatest risk factors for hemorrhagic transformation in these patients. The use of warfarin should be of particular concern to the clinician, because hemorrhagic transformation is associated with poorer functional outcome and morbidity and mortality.",1
"During mucosal injury, intestinal immune cells play a crucial role in eliminating invading bacteria. However, as the excessive accumulation of immune cells promotes inflammation and delays tissue repair, it is essential to identify the mechanism that limits the infiltration of immune cells to the mucosal-luminal interface. Cholesterol sulfate (CS) is the lipid product of the sulfotransferase SULT2B1 and suppresses immune reactions by inhibiting DOCK2-mediated Rac activation. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the physiological role of CS in the intestinal tract. We found that, in the small intestine and colon, CS is predominantly produced in the epithelial cells close to the lumen. While dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis was exacerbated in <i>Sult2b1</i>-deficient mice with increased prevalence of neutrophils, the elimination of either neutrophils or intestinal bacteria in <i>Sult2b1</i>-deficient mice attenuated disease development. Similar results were obtained when the <i>Dock2</i> was genetically deleted in <i>Sult2b1</i>-deficient mice. In addition, we also show that indomethacin-induced ulcer formation in the small intestine was exacerbated in <i>Sult2b1</i>-deficient mice and was ameliorated by CS administration. Thus, our results uncover that CS acts on inflammatory neutrophils, and prevents excessive gut inflammation by inhibiting the Rac activator DOCK2. The administration of CS may be a novel therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced ulcers.",1

"Aberrant expression of XIST, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) initiating X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in early embryogenesis, is a common feature of breast cancer (BC). However, the roles of post-XCI XIST in breast carcinogenesis remain elusive. Here we identify XIST as a key regulator of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs), which exhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase positive (ALDH<sup>+</sup>) epithelial- (E) and CD24<sup>lo</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> mesenchymal-like (M) phenotypes. XIST is variably expressed across the spectrum of BC subtypes, and doxycycline (DOX)-inducible knockdown (KD) of XIST markedly inhibits spheroid/colony forming capacity, tumor growth and tumor-initiating potential. This phenotype is attributed to impaired E-CSC in luminal and E- and M-CSC activities in triple-negative (TN) BC. Gene expression profiling unveils that XIST KD most significantly affects cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, leading to markedly suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 in ALDH<sup>-</sup> bulk BC cells. Exogenous IL-6, but not IL-8, rescues the reduced sphere-forming capacity and proportion of ALDH<sup>+</sup> E-CSCs in luminal and TN BC upon XIST KD. XIST functions as a nuclear sponge for microRNA let-7a-2-3p to activate IL-6 production from ALDH<sup>-</sup> bulk BC cells, which acts in a paracrine fashion on ALDH<sup>+</sup> E-CSCs that display elevated cell surface IL-6 receptor (IL6R) expression. This promotes CSC self-renewal via STAT3 activation and expression of key CSC factors including c-MYC, KLF4 and SOX9. Together, this study supports a novel role of XIST by derepressing let-7 controlled paracrine IL-6 proinflammatory signaling to promote CSC self-renewal.",0

Pharmacotherapy includes β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonists such as mirabegron; however, mirabegron contains a label warning for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 inhibition, making coadministration with CYP2D6 substrates require monitoring and dose adjustment to avoid unintended increases in substrate concentration.",0
"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure in western countries. APAP can cause extensive hepatocellular necrosis, which triggers an inflammatory response involving neutrophil and monocyte recruitment. Particularly the role of neutrophils in the injury mechanism of APAP hepatotoxicity has been highly controversial. Thus, the objective of the current study was to assess whether a potential contribution of neutrophils was dependent on the APAP dose and the sex of the animals. Male and female C57BL/6 J mice were treated with 300 or 600 mg/kg APAP and the injury and inflammatory cell recruitment was evaluated between 6 and 48 h. In both male and female mice, ALT plasma levels and the areas of necrosis peaked at 12-24 h after both doses with more severe injury at the higher dose. In addition, Ly6g-positive neutrophils started to accumulate in the liver at 6 h and peaked at 6-12 h after 300 mg/kg and 12-24 h after 600 mg/kg for both sexes; however, the absolute numbers of hepatic neutrophils in the liver were significantly higher after the 600 mg/kg dose. Neutrophil infiltration correlated with mRNA levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant Cxcl2 in the liver. Treating mice with an anti-Cxcl2 antibody at 2 h after APAP significantly reduced neutrophil accumulation at 24 h after both doses and in both sexes. However, the injury was significantly reduced only after the high overdose. Thus, neutrophils, recruited through Cxcl2, have no effect on APAP-induced liver injury after 300 mg/kg but aggravate the injury only after severe overdoses.",1
"To evaluate the effects of aspirin in the primary prevention, we evaluated disability grades and mortality after ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). A retrospective nation-wide propensity score-matched cohort study was performed using the Korean National Health Information Database. From 3,060,639 subjects who were older than 55 and performed national health examinations in 2004 and 2005, we selected the aspirin group (N = 8770) was composed of patients who had received aspirin prior to cardiovascular events. Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the acquisition times for neurologic disability grades and survival times between the aspirin and control groups. Only in hemorrhagic stroke, the severe neurologic disability risk was higher in the aspirin group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.42). The aspirin group was associated with higher 90-day (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.23-1.44) and long-term mortality risk (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10) after pooling 3 events. The old age was a strong risk factor for 90-day mortality in hemorrhagic stroke (50s: reference; 60s: HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.50-3.25; 70s: HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.48-5.30; 80s: HR 6.69, 95% CI 4.54-9.65; >90s: HR 11.28, 95% CI 6.46-19.70). Pre-aspirin use in cardiovascular events has detrimental effects on severe neurological disability in hemorrhagic stroke and short-/long-term mortality in 3 cardiovascular events. The use of aspirin for the primary prevention especially in the elderly should be very cautious because the old age is a strong risk factor for 90-day mortality after hemorrhagic stroke.",1
"Guidelines do not support the combination of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, due to potential relevant P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated interaction that might result in decreased DOACs concentrations and increased thromboembolic risk. However, there is no systematic data on the safety of this combination. The aim of this study was to find patients concurrently treated with levetiracetam and DOAC, assess their plasma concentrations of DOAC, and the incidence of thromboembolic events. From our registry of patients on anticoagulation drugs we identified 21 patients concomitantly treated with levetiracetam and DOAC, 19 patients with atrial fibrillation and two patients with venous thromboembolism. Eight patients received dabigatran, 9 apixaban and 4 rivaroxaban. For each subject blood samples were collected for determination of trough DOAC and trough levetiracetam concentrations. The average age was 75 ± 9 years, 84% were males, HAS-BLED score was 1.8 ± 0.8, and in patients with atrial fibrillation CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score was 4.6 ± 2.0. The average trough concentration level of levetiracetam was 31.0 ± 34.5 mg/L. Median trough concentrations of DOACs were for dabigatran 72 (range 25-386) ng/mL, for rivaroxaban 47 (range 19-75) ng/mL, and for apixaban 139 (range 36-302) ng/mL. During the observation period of 1388 ± 994 days none of the patients suffered a thromboembolic event. Our results did not demonstrate a reduction in DOACs plasma levels during levetiracetam treatment, suggesting that levetiracetam could not be an important P-gp inducer in humans. DOAC in combination with levetiracetam remained effective therapy to protect against thromboembolic events.",1
"Midbrain and striatal dopamine signals have been extremely well characterized over the past several decades, yet novel dopamine signals and functions in reward learning and motivation continue to emerge. A similar characterization of real-time sub-second dopamine signals in areas outside of the striatum has been limited. Recent advances in fluorescent sensor technology and fiber photometry permit the measurement of dopamine binding correlates, which can divulge basic functions of dopamine signaling in non-striatal dopamine terminal regions, like the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST). Here, we record GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals in the dBNST during a Pavlovian lever autoshaping task. We observe greater Pavlovian cue-evoked dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals in sign-tracking (ST) compared to goal-tracking/intermediate (GT/INT) rats and the magnitude of cue-evoked dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals decreases immediately following reinforcer-specific satiety. When we deliver unexpected rewards or omit expected rewards, we find that dBNST dopamine signals encode bidirectional reward prediction errors in GT/INT rats, but only positive prediction errors in ST rats. Since sign- and goal-tracking approach strategies are associated with distinct drug relapse vulnerabilities, we examined the effects of experimenter-administered fentanyl on dBNST dopamine associative encoding. Systemic fentanyl injections do not disrupt cue discrimination but generally potentiate dBNST dopamine signals. These results reveal multiple dBNST dopamine correlates of learning and motivation that depend on the Pavlovian approach strategy employed.",0
"We aimed to compare the effects of cardiovascular disease risk in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes on sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is) or metformin. This retrospective, real-world cohort study was carried out using a claims database and propensity score matching; 58,402 eligible patients (29,201 per group) were included. The outcomes included nonfatal myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure and composite end-points. The hazard ratio (HR) for the composite end-point was 0.79, which was lower for SGLT2Is than for metformin. For male patients (HR 0.76), patients aged <65 years (HR 0.94), patients aged ≥75 years (HR 0.78) and patients with body mass index ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (HR 0.76), the HRs for the composite end-point were significantly lower in the SGLT2I group than in the metformin group. SGLT2Is might be superior to metformin in reducing the composite risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.",1
"Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondria play a central role in mental health disorders including schizophrenia. Here we investigated whether nicotinamide (NAM) normalized cognitive impairment via a mechanism involving the mitochondrial Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) pathway. The 24 h maternal separation (MS) rat model was used to mimic schizophrenia-associate phenotypes. Schizophrenia-like behaviors and memory impairments were detected using the pre-pulse inhibition test, novel object recognition test, and Barnes maze test, and neuronal apoptosis was characterized using multiple assays. SIRT3 activity was inhibited pharmacologically or by knockdown in HT22 cells, and BV2 microglia and SIRT3-knockdown HT22 cells were co-cultured in vitro. Mitochondrial molecules were measured by western blotting, and mitochondrial damage was measured with reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential assays. Proinflammatory cytokines were assayed by ELISA and microglial activation was detected by immunofluorescence. MS animals showed behavioral and cognitive impairment and increased neuronal apoptosis. Supplementation with NAM or administration of honokiol, a SIRT3 activator, reversed all of the changes in behavioral and neuronal phenotypes. Administration of the SIRT3 inhibitor 3-TYP in control and NAM-treated MS rats caused behavioral and neuronal phenotypes similar to MS. In vitro, inhibition of SIRT3 activity with 3-TYP or by knockdown in HT22 cells increased ROS accumulation and caused neuronal apoptosis in a single-culture system. In co-culture systems, SIRT3 knockdown in HT22 cells activated BV2 microglia and increased levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. The administration of NAM blocked these alterations. Taken together, these data suggest that NAM can rescue neuronal apoptosis and microglial over-activation through the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-SIRT3-SOD2 signaling pathway, furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and providing avenues for novel treatments.",0
"Three-dimensional (3D) liver bioprinting is a promising technique for creating 3D liver models that can be used for<i>in vitro</i>drug testing, hepatotoxicity studies, and transplantation. The functional performance of 3D bioprinted liver constructs are limited by the lack of cell-cell interactions, which calls for the creation of bioprinted tissue constructs with high cell densities. This study reports the fabrication of 3D bioprinted liver constructs using a novel photocrosslinkable gelatin methacrylamide (GelMA)-based bioink formulation. However, the formation of excess free radicals during photoinitiation poses a challenge, particularly during photocrosslinking of large constructs with high cell densities. Hence, we designed a bioink formulation comprising the base polymer GelMA loaded with an antioxidant cocktail containing vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid (AA)) and vitamin E (<i>α</i>-tocopherol (<i>α</i>-Toc)). We confirmed that the combination of antioxidants loaded in GelMA enhanced the ability to scavenge intracellular reactive oxygen species formed during photocrosslinking. The GelMA formulation was evaluated for biocompatibility<i>in vitro</i>and<i>in vivo</i>. These results demonstrated that the bioink had adequate rheological characteristics and was biocompatible. Furthermore, when compared to bioprinted constructs with lower cell density, high-density primary rat hepatocyte constructs demonstrated improved cell-cell interactions and liver-specific functions like albumin and urea secretion, which increased 5-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively.",0
"To analyze the effect of tirofiban on ischemic events in CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) allele carriers during pipeline embolization device (PED) implantation. Demographic information, imaging data, ischemic complications, CYP2C19 genotyping, and platelet function test results were collected from patients with PED-treated intracranial aneurysms at three centers. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors for ischemic events. Patients were grouped according to LOF alleles and antiplatelet drugs, the baseline information of LOF allele carriers and non-carriers were compared, and the efficacy of tirofiban was analyzed by comparing the incidence of ischemic events in each group. In total, 278 patients were included in the study, 24 of whom had an ischemic event. 157 (56.5%) patients carried the LOF allele and were more likely to develop resistance to clopidogrel (P < 0.001) and hypertension (P = 0.010). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent risk factors for ischemic events were age of > 55 years (OR = 3.308, P = 0.028), LOF alleles (OR = 3.960, P = 0.036), and clopidogrel nonresponsiveness (OR = 3.301, P = 0.014). For LOF allele carriers, prophylactic use of tirofiban after PED implantation helped to reduce ischemic events (4.3% vs. 16.4%, P = 0.039). This study supports CYP2C19 genotyping before flow diversion because LOF alleles increase the risk of ischemic events. Prophylactic use of tirofiban may help reduce ischemic events in LOF allele carriers.",1
"Through the application ratio of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the field, L9 (33) orthogonal experimental design was used to study the effects of different N, P and K ratios on the yield and quality of blueberry fruit, aiming to optimize the amount of supplied fertilizers. The results showed that N, P and K fertilizer had different effects on fruit yield and quality, among which K fertilizer was the most important factor. Fertilization could significantly improve the yield and fruit quality of blueberry, and the average yield of fertilization treatment was 37.78% higher than that of the control group (CK). Even the treatment with the worst results F6 (N2P3K1), its single fruit weight, anthocyanins, total phenols, soluble solids and soluble protein content were 1.09, 1.32, 1.23, 1.08 and 1.21 times higher than the control (CK), respectively. Based on the comprehensive evaluation of principal component analysis and multi factor analysis of variance, the best fertilization combination for high-yield and good-quality blueberries was N1P2K2 (F2), that is, the best fertilization effect was that including N 100 g/plant, P2O5 25 g/plant, K2O 25 g/plant, applied in the form of ammonium sulfate (472 g/plant), superphosphate (41 g/plant) and potassium sulfate (40 g/plant), respectively.",0

"To investigate the effect of different DAPTs in patients with ACS undergoing PCI, and to identify the most efficient DAPT to reduce the risk of ischemia and bleeding after PCI. Between March 2017 and December 2021, 1598 patients with ACS who underwent PCI were included in the study. The DAPT protocol included the clopidogrel group (aspirin 100 mg + clopidogrel 75 mg), ticagrelor group (aspirin 100 mg + ticagrelor 90 mg), de-escalation Group 1 (reduced dose of ticagrelor [from 90 mg to 60 mg]) after 3 months of oral DAPT [aspirin 100 mg + ticagrelor 90 mg]), and de-escalation Group 2 (switched from ticagrelor to clopidogrel after 3 months of oral DAPT [aspirin 100 mg + ticagrelor 90 mg]). All patients received a 12-month follow-up. The primary endpoint was net adverse clinical events (NACEs) that included the composite endpoints of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, stroke, and bleeding events. There were 2 secondary endpoints, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) and bleeding. No statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of NACEs between the 4 groups at the average 12-month follow-up (15.7% vs 19.2% vs 16.7% vs 20.4%). Cox regression analysis revealed that DAPT ticagrelor group regimen (hazard ratio [HR] 0.547; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.334-0.896; P  = .017) were associated with a lower risk of MACCEs. Age (HR 1.024; 95% CI: 1.003-1.046; P  = .022). DAPT de-escalation Group 2 regimen (HR 1.665; 95% CI: 1.001-2.767; P  = .049) were marginally associated with a higher risk of MACCEs. Ticagrelor group regimen (HR 1.856; 95% CI: 1.376-2.504; P  < .001) was associated with higher risk of bleeding events. Ticagrelor group regimen (HR 1.606; 95% CI: 1.179-2.187; P  = .003) were associated with a higher risk of minor bleeding events. For patients with ACS underwent PCI, there were no significant difference in the incidence of NACEs between 3 and 12 months after PCI between de-escalation and non-de-escalation therapies. Compared with ticagrelor-based 12-month DAPT, there was no significant difference in MACCEs and bleeding events in patients receiving de-escalation treatment (ticagrelor reduction from 90 to 60 mg, 3 months after PCI).",1
"Alfuzosin hydrochloride (AZH) is co-formulated with solifenacin succinate (SOS) in Solitral® capsules for treating prostate hyperplasia in patients with overactive bladder syndrome. Herein and for the first time, an ultrasensitive synchronous spectrofluorimetric approach coupled with first-order derivative signal processing was designed for simultaneous determination of AZH and SOS in their pure forms, newly-released pharmaceutical capsules, and human biological fluids. AZH and SOS showed their conventional emission spectra in bi-distilled water at 382 nm and 294 nm after excitation at 325 nm and 250 nm, respectively. The native fluorescence intensities of AZH and SOS were greatly enhanced through micellar formation using sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant (2%). The proposed approach included the use of synchronous mode at Δλ of 60 nm where the overlap between the studied analytes' fluorescence spectra wasn't completely resolved. The complete resolution was achieved by derivatization of the synchronized spectra to the first-order yielding two zero-crossing points which allowed the determination of AZH and SOS simultaneously without interference at 408 nm and 321 nm, respectively. Under optimum experimental circumstances, good linearities were accomplished over the concentration ranges of (1-24) ng/mL and (4-250) ng/mL with LOD of 0.26 ng/mL and 1.31 ng/mL for AZH and SOS, respectively. The proposed approach was validated successfully according to guidelines adopted by the ICH and compared statistically with the reported LC method with no discernible differences concerning accuracy or precision at p = 0.05. Successful application of the proposed approach achieved with excellent recovery percentages for analysis of the studied analytes in different matrices (pharmaceutical capsules and biological fluids) confirms its suitability for use in QC laboratories and other bioanalytical applications. The proposed approach's greenness was evaluated using two tools namely; penalty points scoring system and green analytical procedure index (GAPI) divulging excellent greenness of this approach relative to the reported LC method. The proposed approach relied chiefly on water as the cheapest and greenest solvent.",0
"Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an aromatic anticonvulsant known to cause drug hypersensitivity reactions, which range in severity from relatively mild maculopapular exanthema to potentially fatal Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS-TEN). These reactions are known to be associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles, and CBZ interacts preferentially with the related HLA proteins to activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of HLA class II in the effector mechanism(s) of CBZ hypersensitivity. CBZ-specific T-cells clones were generated from two healthy donors and two hypersensitive patients with high-risk HLA class I markers. Phenotype, function, HLA allele restriction, response pathways, and cross-reactivity of CBZ-specific T-cells were assessed using flow cytometry, proliferation analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between HLA class II allele restriction and CBZ hypersensitivity was reviewed using Allele Frequency Net Database. Forty-four polyclonal CD4<sup>+</sup> CBZ-specific T-cell clones were generated and found to be restricted to HLA-DR, particularly <i>HLA-DRB1*07:01</i>. This CD4<sup>+</sup>-mediated response proceeded through a direct pharmacological interaction between CBZ and HLA-DR molecules. Similar to the CD8<sup>+</sup> response, CBZ-stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> clones secreted granulysin, a key mediator of SJS-TEN. Our database review revealed an association between <i>HLA-DRB1*07:01</i> and CBZ-induced SJS-TEN. These findings implicate HLA class II antigen presentation as an additional pathogenic factor for CBZ hypersensitivity reactions. Both HLA class II molecules and drug-responsive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells should be evaluated further to gain better insights into the pathogenesis of drug hypersensitivity reactions.",1

"Perampanel (PER) and lacosamide (LCM) are the new third-generation anti-seizure medications (ASMs) that were approved for the monotherapy of focal epilepsy in children over four years of age in China, in 2021. Very few studies have analyzed the application of PER monotherapy among pediatric patients aged ≥four years, and no study compared the efficacy and tolerability of PER monotherapy with LCM monotherapy in pediatric patients with focal epilepsy. The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy, tolerability, and effect on behavior and emotion of PER and LCM as monotherapy in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy, which is beneficial for clinicians to have more choices to treat pediatric patients with focal epilepsy.",1
"Task-specific dystonia (TSD) confined to the lower extremities (LE) is relatively rare. This report describes dystonia confined to the LE only during forward walking.

"Oxytetracycline (OTC), a commonly used tetracycline antibiotic in aquaculture, has been found to cause significant damage to the liver of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). This study revealed that OTC can lead to severe histopathological damage, structural changes at the cellular level, and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in M. salmoides. Meanwhile, OTC impairs the activities of antioxidant enzyme (such as T-SOD, CAT, GST, GR) by suppressing the activation of MAPK/Nrf2 pathway. OTC disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy through via PINK1/Parkin pathway. The accumulation of damaged mitochondria, combined with the inhibition of the antioxidant enzyme system, contributes to elevated ROS levels and oxidative liver damage in M. salmoides. Further investigations demonstrated that an enzyme-treated soy protein (ETSP) dietary supplement can help maintain mitochondrial dynamic balance by inhibiting the PINK1/Parkin pathway and activate the MAPK/Nrf2 pathway to counteract oxidative damage. In summary, these findings highlight that exposure to OTC disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and inhibits the antioxidant enzyme system, ultimately exacerbating oxidative liver damage in M. salmoides. We propose the use of a dietary supplement as a preventive measure against OTC-related side effects, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic toxicity in aquatic environments.",1
"Acetaminophen (APAP) may cause acute liver injury with therapeutic doses in high-risk conditions such as chronic alcohol consumption or malnutrition.

"BACKGROUND Acute esophageal necrosis, or Gurvits syndrome, is a rare clinical process often secondary to a systemic low-flow state. It can be caused by several medical conditions, and it is thought to arise from a combination of impaired mucosal barrier and chemical and ischemic insults to the esophagus. Acute esophageal necrosis usually presents with severe complications due to delayed diagnosis and only rarely has surgical indications. We present a case of Gurvits syndrome, presumably triggered by metabolic acidosis in a diabetic patient. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old man with history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin, canagliflozin, glimepiride, and pioglitazone came to our attention with persistent vomiting, odynophagia, chest pain after each meal, and progressive weight loss. Arterial blood analysis showed mild metabolic acidosis, while the first esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed revealed a circumferential black appearance of the esophageal mucosa, as in concentric necrosis of the distal esophagus with possible fungal superinfection. Brushing cytology confirmed the infection by Candida spp. and the patient was treated with intravenous fluconazole. The second esophagogastroduodenoscopy, performed after 2 weeks, showed almost complete healing of the esophageal mucosa; in this case, biopsy confirmed mucosal ischemia and necrosis, without showing deep impairment of the mucosa by fungal agents. CONCLUSIONS Due to its high lethality, often caused by the underlying medical diseases, acute esophageal disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of digestive symptoms, even without upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of contextual collateral conditions can help clinicians to avoid the worst outcomes of the disease. Among the causative factors of metabolic acidosis leading to esophageal necrosis we recognized metformin and dapagliflozin.",1
"While controlling blood glucose, patients with diabetes and abnormal coagulation should be treated with positive anticoagulation because the hypercoagulable state of their blood is the primary cause of macroangiopathy.

"Ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes (RPCs) are gaining momentum in photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT), thanks to the possibility of overcoming the classical reliance on molecular oxygen of photodynamic therapy while preserving the selective drug activation by using light. However, notwithstanding the intriguing perspectives, the translation of such an approach in the development of new antimicrobials has been only barely considered. Herein, MTZH-1 and MTZH-2, two novel analogues of metronidazole (MTZ), a mainstay drug in the treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, were designed and inserted in the strained ruthenium complexes [Ru(tpy)(dmp)(MTZ-1)]PF<sub>6</sub> (<b>Ru2</b>) and [Ru(tpy)(dmp)(MTZ-2)]PF<sub>6</sub> (<b>Ru3</b>) (tpy = terpyridine, dmp = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) (Chart 1). Analogously to the parental compound [Ru(tpy)(dmp)(5NIM)]PF<sub>6</sub> (<b>Ru1</b>) (5-nitroimidazolate), the Ru(II)-imidazolate coordination of MTZ derivatives resulted in promising Ru(II) photocages, capable to easily unleash the bioactive ligands upon light irradiation and increase the antibacterial activity against <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, which was chosen as a model of Gram-positive bacteria. The photoreleased 5-nitroimidazole-based ligands led to remarkable phototoxicities under hypoxic conditions (<1% O<sub>2</sub>), with the lead compound <b>Ru3</b> that exhibited the highest potency across the series, being comparable to the one of the clinical drug MTZ. Besides, the chemical architectures of MTZ derivatives made their interaction with NimAunfavorable, being NimA a model of reductases responsible for bacterial resistance against 5-nitroimidazole-based antibiotics, thus hinting at their possible use to combat antimicrobial resistance. This work may therefore provide fundamental knowledge in the design of novel photoresponsive tools to be used in the fight against infectious diseases. For the first time, the effectiveness of the ""<i>photorelease antimicrobial therapy</i>"" under therapeutically relevant hypoxic conditions was demonstrated.",0
"The microbial activities in sewer biofilms are recognized as a major reason for sewer pipe corrosion, malodor, and greenhouse gas emissions. However, conventional methods to control sewer biofilm activities were based on the inhibitory or biocidal effect of chemicals and often required long exposure time or high dosing rates due to the protection of sewer biofilm structure. Therefore, this study attempt to use ferrate (Fe(VI)), a green and high-valent iron, at low dosing rates to damage the sewer biofilm structure so as to enhance sewer biofilm control efficiency. The results showed the biofilm structure started to crush when the Fe(VI) dosage was 15 mg Fe(VI)/L and the damage enhanced with the increasing dosage. The determination of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) showed that Fe(VI) treatment at 15-45 mgFe/L mainly decreased the content of humic substances (HS) in biofilm EPS. This is because the functional groups, such as C-O, -OH, and C=O, which held the large molecular structure of HS, were the primary target of Fe(VI) treatment as suggested by 2D-Fourier Transform Infrared spectra. As a result, the coiled chain of EPS maintained by HS was turned to extended and dispersed and consequently led to a loosed biofilm structure. The XDLVO analysis suggested that both the microbial interaction energy barrier and secondary energy minimum were increased after Fe(VI) treatment, suggesting that the treated biofilm was less likely to aggregate and easier to be removed by the shear stress caused by high wastewater flow. Moreover, combined Fe(VI) and free nitrous acid (FNA) dosing experiments showed for achieving 90% inactivation, the FNA dosing rate could be reduced by 90% with the exposure time decreasing by 75% at a low Fe(VI) dosing rate and the total cost was substantially decreased. These results suggested that applying low-rate Fe(VI) dosing for sewer biofilm structure destruction is expected to be an economical way to facilitate sewer biofilm control.",0
This publication reviews the reported 'rogue' behavior of biological indicators used for vapor phase hydrogen peroxide processes with attention to the aspects of BI design / configuration to identify factors which may contribute to the reported greater variance in resistance. The contributing factors are reviewed with respect to the unique circumstances of a vapor phase process that adds challenges to H2O2 delivery to the spore challenge. The numerous complexities of H2O2 vapor phase processes are described as these contribute to the difficulties encountered. The paper includes specific recommendations for changes to the biological indicator configurations in use and the vapor process to reduce the incidence of rogues.,0
"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high production volume chemical with potential estrogenic effects susceptible to abiotic degradation by MnO<sub>2</sub>. BPA transformation products and reaction mechanisms with MnO<sub>2</sub> have been investigated, but detailed process understanding of Mn(III)-mediated degradation has not been attained. Rapid consumption of BPA occurred in batch reaction vessels with 1 mM Mn(III) and 63.9 ± 0.7% of 1.76 ± 0.02 μmol BPA was degraded in 1 hour at circumneutral pH. BPA was consumed at 1.86 ± 0.09-fold higher rates in vessels with synthetic MnO<sub>2</sub> comprising approximately 13 mol% surface-associated Mn(III) versus surface-Mn(III)-free MnO<sub>2</sub>, and 10-35% of BPA transformation could be attributed to Mn(III) during the initial 10-min reaction phase. High-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) analysis detected eight transformation intermediates in reactions with Mn(III), and quantum calculations proposed 14 BPA degradation products, nine of which had not been observed during MnO<sub>2</sub>-mediated BPA degradation, suggesting mechanistic differences between Mn(III)- versus MnO<sub>2</sub>-mediated BPA degradation. The findings demonstrate that both Mn(III) and Mn(IV) can effectively degrade BPA and indicate that surface-associated Mn(III) increases the reactivity of synthetic MnO<sub>2</sub>, offering opportunities for engineering more reactive oxidized Mn species for BPA removal.",0
"Cardiovascular involvement has been described in acute and recovered COVID-19 patients. Here, we present a case of symptomatic pericarditis with persistent symptoms for at least six months after the acute infection and report 66 published cases of pericarditis in discharged COVID patients. Patient mean age ± SD was 49.7 ± 13.3 years, ranging from 15 to 75 years and 57.6% were female. A proportion of 89.4% patients reported at least one comorbidity, with autoimmune and allergic disorders, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, as the most frequent. Only 8.3% of patients experienced severe symptoms of acute COVID-19. The time between acute COVID and pericarditis symptoms varied from 14 to 255 days. Chest pain (90.9%), tachycardia (60.0%) and dyspnoea (38.2%) were the most frequent symptoms in post-acute pericarditis. A proportion of 45.5% and 87% of patients had an abnormal electrocardiogram and abnormal transthoracic ultrasound, respectively. Colchicine combined with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) were prescribed to 39/54 (72%) patients. Of them, 12 were switched to corticosteroid therapy due to non-response to the first-line treatment. Only 6 patients had persisting symptoms and were considered as non-respondent to therapy.Our report highlights that pericarditis should be suspected in COVID-19 patients with persistent chest pain and dyspnoea when pulmonary function is normal. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and colchicine is usually effective but corticosteroids are sometimes required.",1

"The relationship between surface area and dynamics of processes can be demonstrated by adding iron at room temperature to liquid nitrogen. The rate at which the liquid nitrogen boils to produce gas is related to the surface area of the iron. Adding iron in the form of consistent units that have measurable sizes can be readily connected to observable differences in rates of nitrogen gas production. For example, samples of smaller iron spheres with their greater surface area transfer heat more quickly than do larger spheres of the same volume to liquid nitrogen causing it to boil faster, but more briefly, and produce larger plumes of nitrogen gas from a container vent. The plumes are essentially comprised of nitrogen and water, which make them potentially safer than plumes from other demonstrations such as the ""genie in a bottle"", based on hydrogen peroxide decomposition. These simple activities can be used as stand-alone demonstrations or as the basis of laboratory activities.",0
Heart failure (HF) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality all over the world. Aim of the study was to assess the benefits and harms of sacubitril/valsartan (S/V) compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in patients with HF.,1
"β-blocker therapy is currently the treatment of choice for infantile hemangiomas (IH), albeit with limited data on long-term treatment outcomes. Herein, authors treated 67 IH lesions in 47 patients with oral propranolol at 2 mg/kg/d for a median of 9 mo and followed them up for a median of 48 mo. While no maintenance therapy was required for 18 lesions (26.9%), the rest needed maintenance therapy. Both treatment regimens had comparable efficacy (83.3±23.9% and 92.0±13.8%) but chances of IH recurrence was higher in lesions requiring maintenance therapy. Also, patients treated at ≤5 mo of age had a significantly better response and a lower recurrence rate than patients treated at >5 mo of age (95.0±7.9% vs. 87.0±17.5%, p = 0.05). Authors' experience suggests that longer durations of maintenance therapy offered no added advantage to the overall improvement of IH while treatment initiation at an earlier age showed better improvement and lower recurrence rates.",0
"8-Hydroxygeraniol, an important component of insect sex pheromones and defensive secretions, can be used as a potential biological insect repellent in agriculture. Microbial production provides sustainable and green means to efficiently gain 8-hydroxygeraniol. The conversion of geraniol to 8-hydroxygeraniol by P450 geraniol-8-hydroxylase (G8H) was regarded as the bottleneck for 8-hydroxygeraniol production. Herein, an integrated strategy consisting of the fitness between G8H and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) engineering, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) supply is implemented to enhance the production of 8-hydroxygeraniol in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. The titer of 8-hydroxygeraniol was gradually increased by 2.1-fold (up to 158.1 mg/L). Moreover, dehydrogenase <i>ADH6</i> and reductase <i>ARI1</i> responsible for the reduction of 8-hydroxygeraniol toward shunt products were also deleted, elevating 8-hydroxygeraniol production to 238.9 mg/L at the shake flask level. Consequently, more than 1.0 g/L 8-hydroxygeraniol in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> was achieved in 5.0 L fed-batch fermentation by a carbon restriction strategy, which was the highest-reported titer in microbes so far. Our work not only provides a sustainable way for <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of 8-hydroxygeraniol but also sets a good reference in P450 engineering in microbes.",0
"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia due to persistent insulin resistance, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels. Metformin is the most prescribed oral drug for lowering high blood glucose levels in T2DM patients. However, it is poorly absorbed and has low bioavailability. Here, we introduce magnesium-based microstirrers to a metformin-containing pill matrix to enhance the glucose-lowering effect of metformin. The resulting microstirring pill possesses a built-in mixing capability by creating local fluid transport upon interacting with biological fluid to enable fast pill disintegration and drug release along with accelerated metformin delivery. In vivo glucose tolerance testing using a murine model demonstrates that the metformin microstirring pill significantly improves therapeutic efficacy, lowering blood glucose levels after a meal more rapidly compared to a regular metformin pill without active stirring. As a result, the microstirrers allow for dose sparing, providing effective therapeutic efficacy at a lower drug dosage than passive metformin pills. These encouraging results highlight the versatility of this simple yet elegant microstirring pill technology, which enhances drug absorption after gastrointestinal delivery to improve therapeutic efficacy.",0
"Emerging evidence has indicated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PPARGC1A) is involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its detailed function and up- and downstream mechanisms are incompletely understood. In this study, we confirmed that PPAGC1A is lowly expressed in HCC and is associated with poor prognosis using large-scale public datasets and in-house cohorts. PPAGC1A was found to impair the progression and sensitivity of HCC to lenvatinib. Mechanistically, PPAGC1A repressed bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) by inhibiting WNT/β-catenin signaling. BAMBI mediated the function of PPARGC1A and regulated ACSL5 through TGF-β/SMAD signaling. PPARGC1A/BAMBI regulated ROS production and ferroptosis-related cell death by controlling ACSL5. PPARGC1A/BAMBI/ACSL5 axis was hypoxia-responsive. METTL3 and WTAP silenced PPARGC1A in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent way under normoxia and hypoxia, respectively. Metformin restored PPARGC1A expression by reducing its m6A modification via inhibiting METTL3. In animal models and patient-derived organoids, consistent functional data of PPARGC1A/BAMBI/ACSL5 were observed. Conclusions: These findings provide new insights into the role of the aberrant PPARGC1A/BAMBI/ACSL5 axis in HCC. And the mechanism of PPARGC1A dysregulation was explained by m6A modification. Metformin may benefit HCC patients with PPARGC1A dysregulation.",0
"Phenolic compounds have a positive effect on obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity. The prevalence of these diseases has increased in the last years in the Mexican population. Therefore, the Mexican diet must be assessed as provider of phenolic compounds. To assess this, a survey of phenolic compound intake was validated and applicated to 973 adults (798 females) between 18 and 79 years old. We compared the phenolic compound intake of 324 participants with more diseases (239 females) and 649 participants with healthier condition (559 females). The groups differed in sex, age, and scholarship. Males, older participants, and those with lower schooling reported suffering from more diseases. Regarding phenolic compound intake analyses, the participants with healthier conditions displayed a higher phenolic compound intake than the other group in all foods assessed. In addition, the regression model showed that the phenolic compounds intake of Mexican dishes, such as arroz con frijol or enchiladas, positively affected health status, suggesting that this traditional food is beneficial for the participant's health condition. However, the weight effect of PCI was different for each disease. We conclude that, although PCI of Mexican food positively affects health conditions, this effect depends on sex, age, and participants' diseases.",0
"Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a persistent involuntary complex movement disorder that is known to occur with long-term antipsychotic treatment. Despite being a well-recognized complication of this treatment, its symptoms are often masked by the antipsychotic agents, only to become apparent upon reducing or terminating the treatment. In an effort to advance our understanding of TD pathophysiology and to identify potential therapies, the current study aimed to establish an animal model of TD by administering haloperidol to rats and to evaluate the efficacy of fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), in ameliorating TD symptoms. The study compared the behavioral and biochemical parameters of rats that were treated with either fluvoxamine, tetrabenazine, haloperidol, or saline (control group). The biochemical parameters of interest included the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA). To achieve the study objectives, 32 male Wistar Albino rats were assigned to four different groups. The control group received physiological saline for six weeks. The haloperidol group received 1 mg/kg/ip haloperidol for the first three weeks, followed by two weeks of saline. The haloperidol+fluvoxamine group received 1 mg/kg/ip haloperidol for the first three weeks, followed by 30 mg/kg/ip fluvoxamine. The haloperidol+tetrabenazine group was administered 1 mg/kg/ip haloperidol for the first three weeks, followed by 5 mg/kg/ip tetrabenazine. Behavioral assessments of the rats were performed by measuring vacuous chewing movements. Subsequently, samples were collected from the hippocampus, striatum, and frontal lobe tissues of the rats, and BDNF, NGF, SOD, and MDA levels were measured. The results of the study demonstrated significant differences between the groups with respect to behavioral observations. Furthermore, SOD levels in the hippocampus, as well as BDNF, NGF, and SOD levels in the striatum of the haloperidol+fluvoxamine group were significantly higher than those observed in the haloperidol group. Conversely, MDA levels in the hippocampus were significantly lower in the haloperidol+fluvoxamine group than in the haloperidol group. These findings provide evidence of the beneficial effects of fluvoxamine, acting as a sigma-1 agonist, in treating TD symptoms induced experimentally. The observed benefits were supported by the biochemical investigations performed on brain tissue samples. Therefore, fluvoxamine may be considered as a potential alternative treatment for TD in clinical practice, although further research is needed to corroborate these findings.",0
"Portal hypertension (PH) is the most common complication ofcirrhosis and represents the main driver of hepatic decompensation. The overarching goal of PH treatments in patients with compensated cirrhosis is to reduce the risk of hepatic decompensation (i.e development of ascites, variceal bleeding and/or hepatic encephalopathy). In decompensated patients, PH-directed therapies aim at avoiding further decompensation (i.e. recurrent/refractory ascites, variceal rebleeding, recurrent encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or hepatorenal syndrome) and at improving survival. Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker (NSBB) acting on hyperdynamic circulation/splanchnic vasodilation and on intrahepatic resistance. It has shown superior efficacy than traditional NSBBs in lowering PH in patients with cirrhosis and may be, therefore, the NSBB of choice for the treatment of clinically significant portal hypertension. In primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, carvedilol has been demonstrated to be more effective than endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). In patients with compensated cirrhosis carvedilol achieves higher rate of hemodynamic response than propranolol, resulting in a decreased risk of hepatic decompensation. In secondary prophylaxis, the combination of EVL with carvedilol may prevent rebleeding and non-bleeding further decompensation better than that with propranolol. In patients with ascites and gastroesophageal varices, carvedilol is safe and may improve survival, as long as no impairment of the systemic hemodynamic or renal dysfunction occurs, with maintained arterial blood pressure as suitable safety surrogate. The target dose of carvedilol to treat PH should be 12.5 mg/day. This review summarizes the evidence behind Baveno-VII recommendations on the use of carvedilol in patients with cirrhosis.",1
"Treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) patients with ganciclovir is complicated by toxicity and resistance. This study aimed to develop an intravenous ganciclovir population pharmacokinetic model for post-alloHCT patients and to determine dosing regimens likely to achieve suggested therapeutic exposure targets. We performed a prospective observational single-center pharmacokinetic study in adult alloHCT patients requiring treatment with intravenous ganciclovir for CMV viremia or disease. Samples were analyzed using a validated ultraperformance liquid chromatography method. Population pharmacokinetic analysis and Monte Carlo simulations (<i>n </i>=<i> </i>1000) were performed using Pmetrics for R. Twenty patients aged 18 to 69 years were included in the study. A 2-compartment model with linear elimination from the central compartment and between occasion variability best described the data. Incorporating creatinine clearance (CL<sub>CR</sub>) estimated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation and presence of continuous renal replacement therapy as covariates for ganciclovir clearance improved the model. Compared to current dosing recommendations, simulations demonstrated loading doses were required to achieve a target AUC<sub>24</sub> of 80 to 120 mg.h/L on day 1 of induction therapy. Increased individualization of post-loading induction and maintenance doses based on CL<sub>CR</sub> is required to achieve the suggested exposures for efficacy (AUC<sub>24</sub> >80/>40 mg.h/L for induction/maintenance) while remaining below the exposure thresholds for toxicity (AUC<sub>24</sub> <120/<60 mg.h/L for induction/maintenance). Intravenous ganciclovir dosing in alloHCT patients can be guided by CL<sub>CR</sub> estimated by CKD-EPI. Incorporation of loading doses into induction dosing regimens should be considered for timely achievement of currently suggested exposures.",0
The present trial aimed to prove the non-inferiority of the analgesic efficacy of continuous wound infiltration (CWI) to that of continuous intravenous fentanyl (IV) and to compare the safety of the two methods.,1
"Mass vaccination is the most important strategy to terminate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Reports suggest the potential risk of the development of new-onset or relapse of minimal change disease (MCD) following COVID-19 vaccination; however, details on vaccine-associated MCD remain unclear. A 43-year-old man with MCD, who had been in remission for 29 years, developed nephrotic syndrome 4 days after receiving the third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. His kidney biopsy revealed relapsing MCD. Intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral prednisolone therapy was administered, and his proteinuria resolved within 3 weeks. This report highlights the importance of careful monitoring of proteinuria after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with MCD, even if the disease is stable and no adverse events occurred during previous vaccinations. Our case report and literature review of COVID-19 vaccine-associated MCD indicated that MCD relapse tends to occur later after vaccination and slightly more often following the second and subsequent vaccine doses than new-onset MCD.",0
"Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic used in the treatment of depressive, schizophrenic, or bipolar disorders. It acts on dopamine D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>, histamine, and 5HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5HT<sub>2</sub> receptors. However, it also acts as an antagonist for α<sub>1</sub> receptors causing cardiovascular side effects, including hypotension. We present the case of a patient chronically medicated with Quetiapine who developed hypotension refractory to vasoconstrictors and intraoperative fluid therapy. Noradrenalin has a strong α<sub>1</sub> effect with lower affinity for β<sub>2</sub> receptors unlike adrenalin. This translates into peripheral vasoconstriction and an improved clinical picture. Therefore, it should be considered the vasoactive drug of choice in patients on high doses of Quetiapine.",1

"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare but highly fatal neurological condition mostly caused by prothrombotic conditions like antiphospholipid syndrome, factor V Leiden, and G20210A prothrombin polymorphism. Snake bites are a rare cause of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis that must be recognized and treated promptly to improve survival.",1
"Lignin has been, for a long time, treated as a low-value waste product. To change this scenario, high-value applications have been recently pursued, <i>e.g.</i>, the preparation of hybrid materials with inorganic components. Although hybrid inorganic-based materials can benefit from the reactive lignin phenolic groups at the interface, often responsible for optimizing specific properties, this is still an underexplored field. Here, we present a novel and green material based on the combination of hydroxymethylated lignin nanoparticles (HLNPs) with molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) nanoflowers grown <i>via</i> a hydrothermal route. By bringing together the lubricant performance of MoS<sub>2</sub> and the structural stability of biomass-based nanoparticles, a MoS<sub>2</sub>-HLNPs hybrid is presented as a bio-derived additive for superior tribological performances. While FT-IR analysis confirmed the structural stability of lignin after the hydrothermal growth of MoS<sub>2</sub>, TEM and SEM micrographs revealed a homogeneous distribution of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers (average size of 400 nm) on the HLNPs (average size of 100 nm). Regarding the tribological tests, considering a pure oil as reference, only HLNPs as bio-derived additives led to a reduction in the wear volume of 18%. However, the hybrid of MoS<sub>2</sub>-HLNPs led to a considerably higher reduction (71%), pointing out its superior performance. These results open a new window of opportunity for a versatile and yet underexplored field that can pave the way for a new class of biobased lubricants.",0
"Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder that can affect sensory-motor behaviors in the valproic acid (Val) rodent model of autism. Although whisker deprivation (WD) induces plastic changes in the cortical neurons, tactile stimulation (TS) during the neonatal period may reverse it. Here, we investigate the interaction effects of TS and WD on behavioral and histologic features of barrel cortex neurons in juvenile Val-treated.",1
"Introduction The global proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) market was valued at US$ 2.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to exhibit a compound aggregated growth rate of 4.30% during the forecast period (2020-2027), as they are regularly prescribed for many gastrointestinal disorders, and the treatment usually lasts for a longer period. PPIs are usually combined with antiemetics and prokinetic drugs. The price of PPIs for the same combination varies a lot, which can lead to a lot of financial burden on the patients. Objective To evaluate the cost ratio and percentage cost variation of commonly used PPIs in various combinations. Methodology The cost of different brands of commonly used PPIs in combination with other drugs was analyzed in our study. A total of 21 different combinations (10 capsules/tablets for oral use) were tabulated by referring to the ""Monthly Index of Medical Specialities"" October-December 2021, and 1mg online pharmacy. The cost ratio and percentage cost variation for various brands of a particular strength and dosage form were calculated and compared. Cost ratio > 2 and cost variation > 100% were considered significant. Results The results show a huge variation (1788.88%) in costs of different brands with the highest being rabeprazole 20 mg and domperidone 10 mg (cost ratio: 18.88, percentage cost variation: 1788.88%) in oral formulation, followed by pantoprazole 40 mg and itopride 150 mg. The minimum cost ratio (1.35) and percentage cost variation (1.35%) is for pantoprazole 40 mg and levosulpiride 75 mg. Logistic regression analysis between the number of brands and percentage cost variation gives an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.0923. Conclusion There is a wide variation in the prices of PPIs available in the market, which can inadvertently increase the financial burden of therapy on patients. Physicians need to be made aware of these price differences so that they can choose the best available alternative for patients, which can help in increasing compliance with the prescribed drugs.",0
